{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nIs there a high probability of spontaneous combustion of new energy vehicles?", "answer": "The probability of spontaneous combustion of new energy vehicles is relatively large. According to statistics, there will be a total of 640 new energy vehicle fires in our country Quarter 1 in 2022, and the probability of spontaneous combustion is much higher than that of traditional fuel vehicles.", "reason": "The answer is wrong. Although the probability of spontaneous combustion of new energy vehicles is much higher than that of traditional fuel vehicles, it is still an exception, and the probability of spontaneous combustion is still extremely small.\nSo the above answer has the problem of \"wrong answer\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1, "reference": "2.939 million, this figure is not the cumulative sales of a certain brand, but the sales of new energy vehicles in our country from January to May this year. The Passenger Federation predicts that the sales of new energy vehicles will reach a record high this year, and the annual sales will exceed 8.50 million, and the penetration rate is expected to reach 36%. The current operating status is basically in line with the forecast.\nWhile seeing the good news, we must also face some issues rationally. For example, another set of figures should also be taken seriously. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Emergency Management of the People's Republic of China, there were a total of 640 new energy vehicle fires in Quarter 1 in 2022, which is equivalent to an average of more than 7 new energy vehicle fire accidents per day. The probability is much higher than that of traditional fuel vehicles. It is no exaggeration to say that spontaneous combustion has become one of the main safety hazards of new energy vehicles. Prepare for a rainy day and prevent problems before they occur. We should do the following at ordinary times.\nSome new energy car owners may panic when they see this. In fact, don't worry too much. Spontaneous fire is an exception after all. Now the mainstream tram brands on the market are very good at battery protection, and the failure rate is extremely low. We just need to pay more attention when using the car. Please refer to the following points in battery protection;\n1. Avoid charging the battery to 100% or discharging it to 0% as often as possible, and try to keep the battery charged and discharged within the range of 20-80% to prolong the service life of the battery.\n2 Charge regularly, rather than waiting for the battery to fully run out of booster charge. Choose the right time to charge the battery to around 80%, which can provide enough range when needed and reduce overcharging of the battery.\n3 Before using the charging pile, carefully check whether the socket and cable are intact to ensure that there is no damage or debris. This can avoid short circuits or leakage during use of the charging pile, thereby reducing the risk of spontaneous combustion of the vehicle.\nNew energy owners should also try to avoid wading or driving in bad road conditions, because the battery pack is located at the bottom of the vehicle chassis. If the vehicle wades or drives on bad roads, it is easy to cause damage to the battery pack, thereby increasing the risk of spontaneous combustion. Because the battery pack is installed at the bottom of the vehicle chassis, if the vehicle wades or drags the bottom, it is easy to cause damage to the battery pack and increase the risk of spontaneous combustion. In addition, regular vehicle maintenance and inspection should be done."}

This means that in a major traffic accident, the driver should bear the main responsibility or full responsibility, and his behavior has constituted a traffic accident crime. In special circumstances, even if the driver bears the same responsibility, it may be identified as a traffic accident crime.\n3. After causing a traffic accident, the driver committed escape behavior. The purpose of this behavior is to deliberately evade legal prosecution and flee the scene of the accident.\nTherefore, the lifetime driving ban is a severe penalty for serious traffic violations that cannot be lifted once implemented.
