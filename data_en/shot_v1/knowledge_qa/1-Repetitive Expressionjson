{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat is the reason why cold cars are difficult to start?", "answer": "Cold car start difficulties are usually caused by the following reasons:\n1. Increased oil viscosity: In a low temperature environment, the viscosity of the oil will increase, resulting in poor fluidity. This means that the oil takes longer to reach various parts of the engine, thus increasing the resistance at start-up.\n2. Poor fuel fluidity: When the temperature decreases, the fluidity of the fuel will also decrease, which will make it difficult for the fuel injection system to inject enough fuel into the combustion chamber, thus affecting the normal start of the engine.\n3. Ignition system problems: When the cold car starts, the spark generated by the spark plug may not be sufficient to ignite the mixture, or the spark plug may not function properly due to aging or failure of the ignition coil, distributor, and other components.\n4. Air filter blockage: If the air filter is blocked by dust and impurities, it will cause poor intake, which in turn will affect the normal start of the engine.\n5. Insufficient battery power: The battery's power will be greatly reduced in a low temperature environment, which may result in the failure to provide enough power to drive the starter during startup.\n6. Carbon deposits inside the engine: Prolonged driving and improper maintenance can lead to carbon deposits inside the engine, which can prevent the engine from starting normally.\n7. Throttle valve and intake port blockage: If the throttle valve and intake port are blocked by dirt, it will reduce the air flow, thus affecting the normal start of the engine.\n8. Low fuel pressure: A problem with the fuel pump or fuel pressure regulator can cause the fuel pressure to be too low, which can affect the normal start of the engine.\n9. Fuel filter blockage: Fuel filter blockage can cause fuel flow to be blocked, affecting the normal start of the engine.\n10. Water temperature sensor failure: Water temperature sensor failure may cause the engine Control Unit to fail to correctly judge the operating temperature of the engine, thus affecting the normal start of the engine.\n11. Engine Control Unit (ECU) failure: The ECU is responsible for managing various functions of the engine, including ignition, fuel injection, etc. If the ECU fails, the engine may not start normally.\n12.

{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat is the impact of lowering the gasoline label?", "answer": "If high-grade gasoline is added to a car with a low compression ratio or low-grade gasoline is added to a car with a high compression ratio, there will be a phenomenon of \"delayed combustion\". That is, after the gas mixture in the cylinder is ignited, the combustion speed is lower than the speed of the compression stroke, resulting in a decrease in engine power, an increase in fuel consumption, and even engine damage (knock).\n\n1. Insufficient combustion: The higher the gasoline label, the better the explosion resistance. The lower the label, the faster the combustion speed, which is prone to early combustion and knock, resulting in increased engine carbon deposition, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption.\n2. Engine wear: Knock will cause the piston, connecting rod, crankshaft and other components to resonate, which will increase the wear of the internal parts of the engine in the long run;\n\n3. Engine failure light is on: When the engine is in a low-load working state for a long time due to oil reasons, the engine computer cannot adjust the fuel injection volume and ignition timing according to the actual working conditions, which may cause the engine failure light to light up.", "reason": "The answers are well organized and there is no duplication.\nSo there is no question of \"repetition\" in the above answer\nSo the result is [[B]]", "label": 0}
