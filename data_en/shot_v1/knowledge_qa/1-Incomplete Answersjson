{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat are the serious consequences if the oil pump cannot be effectively dissipated?", "answer": "If the oil pump cannot effectively dissipate heat, it may shorten the lifespan of the oil pump. The oil pump needs to rely on gasoline to cool down. If the gasoline cannot overflow the oil pump, the oil pump cannot be effectively dissipated, resulting in a shortened lifespan of the oil pump.", "reason": "In the reference answer, the oil pump cannot be effectively dissipated, which will shorten the life of the oil pump and damage the oil pump. So there are 2 points, and the model answer needs to contain at least 2 points.\nThe model answer gives the main point of shortening the life of the oil pump.\nThe reference answer has two main points, and the answer gives one main point.\nSo the above answer has the problem of \"incomplete answer\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1, "reference": "If the oil pump cannot be effectively dissipated, the following serious consequences may occur:\nOil pump life is shortened: The oil pump needs to rely on gasoline to cool down.

{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWill long-term failure to maintain and inspect a motorcycle cause mechanical failure or malfunction?", "answer": "Yes. Long-term failure to perform regular maintenance and repair may result in mechanical failure or equipment failure.", "reason": "The results provide too little practical information, simply answering questions without providing more specific information, such as reasons.\nSo the above answer has the problem of \"incomplete answer\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1, "reference": "Yes, motorcycles that are not maintained and inspected for a long time may lead to mechanical failure or failure. Motorcycles are complex mechanical devices that require regular maintenance and inspections to ensure their proper operation. If not maintained and maintained for a long time, motorcycles may experience various problems, including engine damage, brake failure, flat tires, broken frames, etc.\nFor example, if the motorcycle does not change the oil for a long time, clean up the carbon deposits, etc., it may cause the engine power to drop, the fuel consumption to increase, and in severe cases, it may even cause the engine to overheat and the cylinder to be damaged. In addition, if the key components such as tires and brakes are not checked for a long time, these components may be worn and aged, which may affect the safety performance of the motorcycle.\nTherefore, in order to ensure the safety and normal operation of the motorcycle, the owner should regularly carry out maintenance and maintenance of the motorcycle, including changing the oil, cleaning the carbon deposits, checking the brakes, tires and other key components. If the motorcycle malfunctions or abnormal conditions, it should be inspected and repaired in time to avoid the problem and the occurrence of safety accidents."}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nHow about the protective ability of motorcycle helmets?", "answer": "Okay, here's a concise reply:\n\nHello! To evaluate the protective capabilities of motorcycle helmets, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Standard certification: It is best to choose a helmet certified by a professional organization when purchasing. These helmets usually meet international or domestic standards, such as European Union ECE R25, US DOT, etc.\n\n2. Protection: A good helmet should cover the head and ears and be able to disperse impact energy in the event of a collision.\n\n3. Material strength: The helmet material should be strong enough to withstand the impact force during high-speed driving. Common materials include polyurethane, carbon fiber, etc.\n\n4. Internal structure: The inside of the helmet should have adjustable padding and linings to ensure a tight fit between the helmet and the head, reducing the risk of neck injury.\n\nI hope the above information is helpful to you!", "reason": "To explain the protective ability of a motorcycle helmet, it can be explained from the aspects of \"helmet material\", \"key parts of protection\", and \"internal structure\". The model answer needs to include three main points.\nThe model answers include \"standard certification\", \"scope of inclusion\", \"material strength\", \"internal structure\", etc., and include 4 key points.\nSo there's no question of incomplete answers.\nSo the result is [[B]]", "label": 0}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat are the serious consequences if the oil pump cannot be effectively dissipated?", "answer": "If the oil pump fails to dissipate heat effectively, it may lead to the following consequences:\n\n1. Oil pump overheating damage: Without effective heat dissipation, the temperature of the oil pump may continue to rise, eventually causing damage to the oil pump.\n\n2. Engine performance degradation: When the oil pump fails to function properly, it will result in insufficient engine fuel supply, which will affect the performance and lifespan of the engine.\n\n3. Engine failure: If the oil pump has been unable to dissipate heat and continue to work, it may cause various engine failures, such as oil leakage, abnormal noise, etc.\n\nTherefore, it is very important to ensure that the oil pump can effectively dissipate heat, otherwise it may pose a serious threat to the performance and safety of the car.", "reason": "In the reference answer, the oil pump cannot be effectively dissipated, which will shorten the life of the oil pump and damage the oil pump.

{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat should I do if the brake light or water temperature light is on?", "answer": "1. Brake light on: First check whether the brake oil is sufficient. If the brake oil level is normal, it may be that the brake pads are seriously worn or there is a problem with the brake system. It is recommended to go to a professional auto repair shop for inspection and repair as soon as possible.\n\n2. Water temperature light on: This usually indicates that the engine coolant temperature is too high. Stop immediately and let the engine cool naturally. Do not turn off the flame immediately, as this will cause the overheated coolant inside the engine to fail to circulate. After the water temperature drops, check whether the coolant is sufficient. If there is any shortage, add the coolant. If the coolant is sufficient but the water temperature light is still on, it may be that the cooling system is faulty and needs to be repaired at a professional auto repair shop in time.", "reason": "In the reference answer, the brake light or water temperature light is on, and it is necessary to ensure safety, check the brake system, check the water temperature, and seek help.

The model answer needs to contain at least 3 points.\nThe model answers gave two main points: \"check the brake system\" and \"check the water temperature\".\nThe reference answer has 3 or more points, and the answer gives 2 points. The 2 points in the answer are given in great detail, and each point is explained in detail.\nSo there's no question of incomplete answers.\nSo the result is [[B]]", "label": 0, "reference": "Ensure safety: Ensure the safety of your vehicle and surrounding roads before taking any measures. If possible, pull over to the side of the road and turn off the engine.\nCheck the braking system: If the brake lights are on, first check the braking system. If the brake light is always on, it may be that the braking system is faulty. In this situation, you need to reduce your speed and find a safe place to stop as soon as possible.\nCheck the water temperature: If the water temperature indicator light is on, it may be that the coolant temperature is too high. In this case, the engine should be turned off and wait for the coolant temperature to drop. After the coolant temperature drops, you can try to restart the engine.\nSeek help: If the brake lights or water temperature lamps are still on, or if there is another malfunction, seek help or contact rescue services as soon as possible.\nIn conclusion, when the brake light or water temperature light is on, appropriate measures should be taken in time to ensure the safety of the vehicle and surrounding roads. If the problem cannot be solved, seek help or contact rescue services as soon as possible."}
