{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWill long-term failure to maintain and inspect a motorcycle cause mechanical failure or malfunction?", "answer": "Answer: Of course, long-term failure to maintain and inspect motorcycles can lead to mechanical failure or malfunction.\n\n** The reasons are as follows: **\n\n*** Engine: ** Long-term unmaintained engines can cause insufficient oil and gas mixing, air intake system blockage, spark plug damage and other problems, resulting in engine performance degradation, resulting in mechanical failure or failure.\n*** Transmission system: ** Long-term unmaintained transmission systems can cause problems such as chain wear and damage to the drive shaft, resulting in a decrease in the function of the transmission system, which in turn can cause mechanical failure or malfunction.\n*** Braking system: ** Long-term unmaintained braking systems can cause problems such as insufficient braking force and insufficient brake fluid, resulting in reduced braking performance, which in turn can lead to mechanical failure or malfunction.\nOther components that are not maintained for a long time, such as tires, electrical systems, etc., can also cause mechanical failure or malfunction.\n\nOverall, long-term failure to maintain and inspect a motorcycle can lead to mechanical failure or malfunction due to the damage and functional degradation of various components, which affects the overall performance and safety of the motorcycle.", "reason": "The format of answering \"Answer:...\" at the beginning is very mechanical, and you should start answering the question directly\nSo the above answer is \"mechanical\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat is the reason for the red flag h5 jitter?", "answer": "As a big language model, I can only provide some suggestions and possible reasons. There may be several reasons for the shaking of your vehicle H5: First, it may be the vibration caused by the imbalance of the tires; second, it may be the vibration of the vehicle caused by the problem of the suspension system; in addition, it may also be the body shaking caused by the fault of the power system such as the resonance or abnormal noise caused by the engine, exhaust pipe and other components. The specific situation requires professional technicians to check and analyze in order to obtain accurate diagnosis results and formulate appropriate solutions", "reason": "The \"as a large language model\" at the beginning of the answer indicates the respondent's robot identity, which is very mechanical and should be deleted directly.\nSo the above answer is \"mechanical\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nThe accelerator pedal fails at high speed", "answer": "Q: What should I do if the accelerator pedal fails while the car is driving at high speed?\nA: The vehicle should be slowed to a safe speed as soon as possible, and attempts should be made to repair or replace the accelerator pedal.\n\nQ: How to repair or replace the accelerator pedal?\nA: First, you need to stop the vehicle, then check whether the accelerator pedal is damaged, and replace it with a new one if necessary. If the accelerator pedal is just faulty, the problem can be fixed by repairing or reinstalling it.\n\nQ: How to drive a vehicle in an emergency?\nA: If the accelerator pedal fails, you can use the emergency brake to slow down the vehicle, and control the direction of the vehicle by continuously applying the brakes. At the same time, it is recommended to be vigilant when driving, pay attention to the surrounding environment and road conditions to ensure driving safety.", "reason": "The answer is in the form of self-question and self-answer.
