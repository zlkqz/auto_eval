{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat is the reason why cold cars are difficult to start?", "answer": "There are many reasons why cold cars are difficult to start, including the following:\n\n1. Fuel system problems: When the engine cools down, the gasoline in the fuel line and nozzle of the fuel system may solidify or become sticky, causing the fuel to not flow smoothly into the cylinder. In addition, the fuel pump may not be able to provide enough pressure to send the fuel into the fuel injection system due to the low temperature.\n\n2. Low battery power: In cold weather, the electrolyte of the car battery will become more viscous, causing the resistance between the electrodes to increase, thus reducing the output capacity of the battery. If the battery is low, it may not be able to provide enough power to the starter to start the engine.\n\n3. Engine oil problem: Engine oil will become thicker and less fluid at low temperatures, resulting in increased frictional resistance inside the engine. This will not only make it difficult to start the engine, but may also cause damage to the engine.\n\nTo solve the problem of difficulty in starting a cold car, you can try replacing the oil, battery, and other methods.", "reason": "The question is why the cold car is difficult to start.\nThe latter part of the answer is about the solution to the difficulty of starting the cold car, which is not related to the reason required for the problem and belongs to redundant content, but the content is still related to the \"reason why the cold car is difficult to start\" of the problem, and the space is very short, so it does not count as the main body of the content is inaccurate.\nSo there is no question of \"inaccurate content subject\" in the above answer\nSo the result is [[B]]", "label": 0}

{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWill long-term failure to maintain and inspect a motorcycle cause mechanical failure or malfunction?", "answer": "Yes, long-term failure to maintain and inspect a motorcycle can lead to mechanical failure or malfunction.\nIf the motorcycle is not maintained and inspected for a long time, the oil, tire pressure and other components may age or be damaged, which may affect the normal operation of the motorcycle. In addition, if the motorcycle's wires or other electronic components are not replaced or inspected in time, it may also cause the motorcycle to malfunction.\nTherefore, regular maintenance and inspection of motorcycles is essential to ensure their normal operation and extend their service life.", "reason": "The results are clearly stated, the subject is clear, and the questions are clearly answered, without redundancy.\nSo there is no question of \"inaccurate content subject\" in the above answer\nSo the result is [[B]]", "label": 0}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat should I do if my vehicle suddenly catches fire?", "answer": "When a vehicle suddenly catches fire, the following measures should be taken:\n\n** 1. Safety first, leave the vehicle in time **\n\nWhen a vehicle suddenly catches fire, get out of the vehicle immediately, stay away from the source of the fire, and stay away from the vehicle. Avoid contact with any combustible materials, including the vehicle itself, fuel, oil, etc.\n\n** 2. Use fire extinguishing tools **\n\nIf fire extinguishing tools are installed on the vehicle, such as fire extinguishing powder, water bags, etc., use them in time. If there are no fire extinguishing tools on the vehicle, try to use fire-extinguishing substances such as water and sand.\n\n** 3. Ask for help **\n\nIf a fire breaks out in a vehicle and cannot be contained, or if the fire spreads to other vehicles or buildings, seek immediate help. Call the emergency number and notify the relevant personnel.\n\n** Notes: **\n\nIn an emergency, don't hesitate to act quickly.\nAfter leaving the vehicle, maintain a distance from the source of the fire.\nIf a vehicle catches fire, do not attempt to extinguish the fire.\nIf a vehicle catches fire, do not attempt to move it.\nIf the vehicle catches fire, do not use water or other liquids.\n\nHere are some ways to prevent vehicle fires:\n\nMaintain vehicles regularly, including checking electrical systems, fluids, etc.\nDo not use combustible substances such as alcohol, flavors, etc. in vehicles.\nPay attention to driving behaviors such as speeding, sudden acceleration, and sudden braking.\nPeriodically check your vehicle's insurance to ensure that it covers possible losses.\n\n** Notes: **\n\nThe above content is for reference only, and the actual operation should be adjusted according to the actual situation.", "reason": "The question is how to deal with a vehicle fire, but several paragraphs in the answer on methods to prevent a vehicle fire have nothing to do with handling measures after a fire, and are redundant content\nSo the above answer has the problem of \"inaccurate content subject\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
