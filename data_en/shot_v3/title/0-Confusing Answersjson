Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nIn recent years, the development of new energy vehicles has been relatively rapid, and various car companies have launched many fashionable and handsome models with good quality, which has attracted the favor of many riders. Some riders expressed interest in new energy models and want to know the maintenance cost of new energy models. Take the Qichen D60 EV2022 PLUS SI Comfort Edition as an example. Let's take a look at the cost of this car in the first year.\nIn terms of car cost, let's first look at its energy consumption. The 2022 PLUS SI Comfort Edition of the Qichen D60 EV is equipped with a pure electric 120kW (163Ps) front single motor with a maximum torque of 280N · m. Equipped with a lithium iron phosphate battery, the capacity is 47kWh, and it supports fast charging. Its MIIT pure electric cruising range is 420km, and the power consumption of 100 kilometers is 12.9kWh/100km. We calculate according to the 10,000 kilometers driven a year, the kilowatt-hour electricity is 0.8 yuan, and the annual electricity bill is about 1032 yuan.\nSecondly, in terms of insurance, the guiding price of the car is 139,800, and it is necessary to spend 1450 yuan (including purchase tax 0 yuan, compulsory traffic insurance 950 yuan, license fee 500 yuan, vehicle and ship tax 0 yuan), commercial insurance 5053 yuan (including third-party liability insurance according to 2 million yuan compensation calculation, the cost is 2133 yuan, vehicle loss insurance 2200 yuan, other vehicle liability insurance (driver), vehicle liability insurance (passenger), body scratch insurance total about 720 yuan, the compensation amount can be selected according to your own needs)\nMaintenance costs: for new energy, the first year of the new car almost do not have to do too much maintenance, the general first warranty in 5000 kilometers, and the first warranty is a gift, the rest of the maintenance content required for every 5000 kilometers is basically the maintenance of air conditioning or brake pads, to 10,000 kilometers a year, the annual maintenance cost is about 300 yuan.\nIn addition to these necessary expenses, there will be some inevitable parking fees, high-speed fees, car wash fees, etc. in daily life, as well as accidental illegal fees. This fee is too uncertain, and it should be considered according to your actual situation. We are about 200 yuan a month and 2,400 yuan a year.\nAfter the above introduction, we can calculate that the Qichen D60 EV 2022 PLUS SI Comfort Edition will cost a total of 10,235 yuan per year in terms of energy costs, insurance costs, maintenance costs and daily expenses, which is equivalent to 853 yuan per month. If there is no risk, the subsequent insurance premium will be reduced, and the cost of using the car will also decrease.

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nInsert mixed Accord, castrate the trunk, and the sales volume in June did not exceed 10,000!\nCar show coffee 07-18 Follow\nHonda Accord, as a joint venture B-class car, has always had a very good market reputation and market sales in the domestic market with its good design, high product strength and comfortable driving experience.\nHowever, for such a hot-selling joint venture car, after this year's replacement, especially in the new energy era, Honda Accord's sales have also experienced a very serious decline.\n\nAccording to the data, in June 2023, Honda Accord's sales were 9,008 units, a year-on-year decrease of 57.58% and a month-on-month decrease of 22.06%. It is extremely rare for Accord to experience year-on-year and month-on-month declines at the same time.\nYou know, in April this year, Honda Accord's sales reached 25,590 units, while in May this year, although Accord's sales declined month-on-month, reaching 11,783 units, it was still able to achieve monthly sales of over 10,000 units.\nAfter the 11th generation Accord was launched on the market, it could be said that the Accord almost lost its previous competitive advantage in the full sales month of June this year. Because in June this year, the sales of the Toyota Camry, which was also a joint venture B-class car, had reached 24,036 units, while the sales of the Nissan Teana, although not as good as the Toyota Camry, also reached 11,123 units, which means that among the Japanese B-class cars, the Accord's sales have reached the bottom.\n\nOf course, in the automotive market, there are many cases of failed replacement models, such as Nissan's three-cylinder Qijun and Ford's Focus models. Whether it is a three-cylinder engine or a reduction in the distribution, the model will eventually fail. But in fact, the Honda Accord did not make serious mistakes, but there are many reasons, including the design, trunk and charging method, which are unacceptable to many consumers.\nThe 11th generation Accord plug-in hybrid model is equipped with a 2.0L naturally aspirated engine with a maximum power output of 109kW and a torque of 182N · m. The motor is a front layout, with a total power output of 135kW and a total torque of 335N · m. The battery is provided by Ningde Times, with an energy of 17.7kWh. Under WLTC conditions, the pure electric cruising range is 82km, and the comprehensive fuel consumption under feed state is 4.88L/100km.\nFrom the data analysis, whether it is fuel consumption or performance, in addition to the unsatisfactory battery life of the Accord, in other aspects, the Accord's comprehensive product strength is still quite good.\nHowever, when designing Accord products in the early stage, the plug-in hybrid model was not taken into account, so the new Accord plug-in hybrid version had no way to lay the battery tiled on the chassis of the vehicle, and could only find another space for the battery. Therefore, the space in the trunk was sacrificed, and the high bulge in the back row also affected the space in the back row, making Honda, known as the \"space master\", unable to start.\nIn addition, as a plug-in hybrid model, the Honda Accord is not equipped with a fast charging function, which means that if the plug-in hybrid version of the Accord is driven solely on electricity, it is difficult to solve the charging problem, and it cannot meet the needs of consumers for daily driving.\nWrite at the end of the article\nFrom the perspective of fuel vehicles, the new Accord does have a good comprehensive product strength, but as a plug-in hybrid model, the Accord is actually not outstanding in the new energy market, especially for consumers who consider comfort and have requirements for the trunk. Whether the Honda Accord plug-in hybrid version can meet their needs remains a question worth considering.", "answer": "🚗 Sheng created a set of main titles and subtitles, titled \"💦 101,000 kilometers of Honda Accord plug-in hybrid battery life experience,\" and subtitled \"How much battery life?
