Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nIn the Chinese car market, for the Japanese luxury brand Lexus, compared to the German top three BBA, although it is far from the sales volume and market share, but in terms of premium retention ability, dealer health, and value retention rate, Lexus has the capital of Xiaoao BBA. Its LX, LM and other models have staggering price increases based on their expensive pricing, and the three-year value retention rate exceeds 100%.\nAs the sales responsibility of Lexus, it is also the first model of Lexus in the Chinese market with a monthly sales volume of over 10,000. The Lexus ES has also had a brilliant and arrogant price increase moment. The price increase was once 20,000 (the nominal disguised price increase of the decoration and maintenance package), but now this car has not only ended the price increase, but also given a 20% discount. The price reduction is about 2-30,000, and in some places even more. And even the value retention rate of the Lexus ES, which was once very eye-catching, has begun to slowly decline. The latest value retention rate research report of the China Automobile Dealers Association shows that the value retention rate of the Lexus ES has dropped from 77.3% in April to 74.8%.\nThe Lexus ES is no longer as beautiful as it was a few years ago. What's going on? So, why is the Lexus ES not working?\nIn fact, it is very simple. On the one hand, the impact brought by the strong rise of Tesla and the Chinese brand electric vehicle army, Lexus has long been no longer a market star, and on the other hand, Lexus itself has been slow to turn around in the face of the general trend of electrification and intelligence. Just like the appearance and interior of this generation of Lexus ES was very stunning when it was first launched, but now many electric vehicles have the shape of a coupe, and the interior is also very sci-fi, becoming a new fashion. In terms of power, the Lexus ES naturally aspirated engine, especially the power meat of the Lexus ES 200 model 2.0 self-priming engine, has been complained and mocked, and even reduced to Internet jokes. It is even more \"weak chicken\" in the face of the fierce power acceleration of the motor. Regarding the intelligent configuration of technology, the Lexus ES has been sidelined by Chinese brand models.\nOf course, this does not mean that the Lexus ES car has fallen behind. On the contrary, this car still has its own unique advantages, such as a very distinctive appearance, an oriental aesthetic interior design, delicate material workmanship, comfortable and smooth driving, and Lexus' always excellent quality, stability, reliability, worry-free and after-sales services. In fact, Lexus ES itself has done nothing wrong, but it is an abbreviation for Lexus' lack of follow-up in the competition.\nIn 2022, Lexus sold nearly 184,000 vehicles in China, a year-on-year decline of more than 16%, which is the first time in its 16 years in China that sales have declined. In the first five months of this year, Lexus sold about 54,000 vehicles, a year-on-year decline of more than 24%. Among them, Quarter 1, Lexus sold 30,258 vehicles, a year-on-year decline of 37%.", "answer": "Here is a pair of main and subheadings generated for you:\n\nMain title: Lexus ES is no longer beautiful, why did it fall here?\nSubtitle: Analyzing the reasons for the decline in Lexus ES sales and exploring the future development path\n\nI hope the above content is helpful to you!", "reason": "Answers such as \"Here is a pair of main and subheadings generated for you\" and \"Hope the above content helps you!\" will give the reader the feeling of talking to a robot and need to be deleted.\nSo the above answer is \"mechanical\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}

Today, this one is Chery's Tiggo 9, which is also equipped with Chery's product technology accumulated over the years. We take Tiggo 9 2023 400T four-wheel drive flagship version 7 seats as an example, and sell 209,900 to see the static performance of this car.\nTiggo 9 also adopts the latest design of the family in the exterior design. The front face grid occupies a large area and is oval-shaped, and the interior is embellished with straight trim strips, making the front of the car look extra energetic.

The 12.3-inch dual screen provides a good one. The technical car is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip. Whether it is the operation response speed or the feedback brought by the touch, it can have a good intelligent experience. The steering wheel is also a three-frame multi-function steering wheel, and a large number of leather materials are used in the car in terms of materials. Full of luxury.\nIn the space part, the size of the Tiggo 9 is 4820x1930x1710MM, and the wheelbase is 2820MM. The space performance is generous. The seats are made of leather seats, which are 2 + 3 and 2 + 3 + 2 seat layouts.

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nAt the time node one month after the listing and before the official delivery, Lantu Chasing Light \"urgently\" launched a 72,000 yuan free optional package, which synchronously simplified the configuration. The models were adjusted from three to two, which was indeed as the official said \"full matching at the beginning\".\nAfter this model adjustment, the two models of Lantu Chasing Light are only the difference between battery packs, and other configurations remain the same; in addition, after adjustment, it is basically equivalent to \"price reduction\". Compared with the price at the time of listing, the price of the entry-level model has not changed, and the price of the top match has been reduced. At the same time, there is a limited-time discount of \"72,000 yuan optional package 0 yuan to start\".\nThis change in rights and interests is a big benefit for users who have booked or are about to book a car, and it also avoids the occurrence of \"backstabbing\" incidents.\nIn addition to being happy, it can't help but make everyone question: Why is there such a big discount when Lantu Chasing Light \"comes to the door\"?\nLu, CEO of Lantu Automobile, mentioned in an exclusive interview with the Shanghai Auto Show media that \"we hope that this year's sales can be doubled by 1-2 times on the basis of last year's (sales), which is our bottom line requirement\". In 2022, Lantu Automobile sold a total of 19,400 new cars throughout the year, which means that the sales target of Lantu in 2023 is 40,000-60,000.\nFrom January to April this year, the cumulative sales of Lantu automobiles were 9021 vehicles, which was less than 25% of the annual sales target of 40,000 vehicles, and there was still 85% of the progress bar to go from the annual sales target of 60,000 vehicles.\nObviously, light chasing is the core product of Landscape's sales target this year, and its success will also be linked to Landscape's fate!\nOn May 14 not long ago, the relevant person in charge of Lantu Automobile confirmed that \"Yu Fei, the general manager of sales, left for personal reasons\", becoming another major personnel change after Liu Zhanshu (formerly the deputy general manager of Lantu Automobile Sales and Service Company). Yu Fei used to serve as the general manager of Ola brand marketing and the general manager of WEY brand car brand. He has just arrived at Lantu Automobile for less than a year. Industry experts speculate that Yu Fei's departure is closely related to the sales volume of Lantu's market.\nAfter the launch, the model configuration was changed. Lantu Chasing Light was not a precedent. It was Xiaopeng G9 before. The difference is that the G9 is too complicated with its own SKU, while Chasing Light is to create a unique choice at this price and impact sales.\nSince its release on December 15, as of its official launch on January 13, Lantu Chasing Light has officially announced that the order has exceeded 10,000 vehicles. However, the specific order volume after Chasing Light's listing has not been continuously announced.\nAfter simplifying the configuration and launching a limited-time free upgrade 72,000 optional package, the cost performance of Landscape Chasing has been greatly improved, and it is more confident in the face of competing NIO ET7.\nBoth medium and large cars can also be exchanged for electricity. Let's take a look at the comparison of the parameters of the two cars.\nLantu Chasing Light is equipped with Lantu ESSA + SOA intelligent electric bionic body, which loads a number of technologies and functions such as \"intelligent electric four-wheel drive\", \"semi-solid battery\", \"user co-creation\", etc. The overall size is relatively small, which is a circle smaller than the NIO ET7.\nFrom the perspective of power parameters, both models are equipped with dual-motor four-wheel drive as standard. The maximum power and torque of the Landscape Chaser are not as good as those of the NIO ET7, but the acceleration time of 100 kilometers is 3.8s, which is the same as that of the NIO ET7. In terms of control, the maximum lateral G value of the Landscape Chaser reaches 1.0G, and the elk test result reaches 83km/h; the maximum lateral G value of the NIO ET7 reaches 1.039G, and the elk test result is the highest at 77km/h.\nIn terms of battery life, Chaser is equipped with a larger capacity battery pack, with a maximum battery life of 730km, and is the same as ET7, which can be purchased by leasing battery packs.\nThe 8155 chip is used in both models, and Lantu Chasing Light realizes four-screen interaction. Compared with the ET7, a 12.3-inch passenger entertainment screen and a small 9-inch central control screen are added, providing a stronger screen selection function.\nIn terms of intelligent driver assistance, compared to light chasing, NIO ET7 has added 1 lidar, 2 millimeter-wave radars, and 5 cameras. In terms of hardware, it can be said to be a monster, and it is also ready to use radar waves combined with visual recognition. However, it is still impossible to leave the high-precision map.\nLantu's light chasing features are remote car moving and memory parking. The car cloud collaborative computing based on Lantu's central SOA electronic and electrical architecture supports straight-line 30m self-selected parking space parking tasks. Even if people are in a distant foreign country, they can precisely control vehicles thousands of miles away through their mobile phones; after 1 learning, they can realize up to 1KM self-tracking parking into parking spaces and summoning parking out.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned related configurations, Landmap Chasing Light provides a free 72,000 yuan optional package for a limited time, which can add seat massage, L2.9 intelligent driving assistance package, CDC + empty suspension with magic carpet function and other comfort configurations for free.\nConclusion:\nCompared with ET7, is it worth buying? The author thinks it is worth it. The product is not inferior to NIO ET7. The starting price is nearly 134,100 yuan lower than ET7. It can also be installed for free for a limited time 72,000 yuan optional package, which is more cost-effective.
