{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat is the reason why cold cars are difficult to start?", "answer": "Cold car start difficulties are usually caused by the following reasons:\n1. Increased oil viscosity: In a low temperature environment, the viscosity of the oil will increase, resulting in poor fluidity. This means that the oil takes longer to reach various parts of the engine, thus increasing the resistance at start-up.\n2. Poor fuel fluidity: When the temperature decreases, the fluidity of the fuel will also decrease, which will make it difficult for the fuel injection system to inject enough fuel into the combustion chamber, thus affecting the normal start of the engine.\n3. Ignition system problems: When the cold car starts, the spark generated by the spark plug may not be sufficient to ignite the mixture, or the spark plug may not function properly due to aging or failure of the ignition coil, distributor, and other components.\n4. Water temperature sensor failure: Water temperature sensor failure may cause the engine Control Unit to fail to correctly judge the operating temperature of the engine, thus affecting the normal start of the engine.\n5. Engine Control Unit (ECU) failure: The ECU is responsible for managing various functions of the engine, including ignition, fuel injection, etc. If the ECU fails, the engine may not start normally.\n6. When starting a cold car, the engine may fail to start normally due to excessive mixture.\n7. When starting a cold car, the engine may not start properly due to the thin mixture.\n8. When starting a cold car, the engine may not start properly due to the premature ignition time.", "reason": "In the answer, \"When the cold car starts, the fuel pump supply pressure is too low, which may cause the engine to fail to start normally.\" Repeated many times, it needs to be deleted, and the only sentence can be kept.\nSo there is a problem of \"duplication\" in the above answer\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nThe spark plug is not working properly, what will be the impact on the car?", "answer": "Spark plugs that don't work properly can cause various problems with a car's engine, including:\n1. Power drop: The spark plug cannot ignite the fuel normally, causing the engine power to drop.\n2. Increased fuel consumption: The engine cannot burn fuel normally, resulting in increased fuel consumption.\n3. Increased emissions: The engine cannot burn fuel normally, resulting in increased emissions.\n4. Difficulty starting: The spark plug cannot ignite the fuel normally, causing difficulty in starting the car.\n5. Shake and noise: Spark plugs fail to ignite fuel normally, causing engine shake and increased noise.\nTherefore, timely replacement and maintenance of spark plugs is essential for the normal operation of a vehicle.", "reason": "In the answer, \"the spark plug cannot ignite the fuel normally\" and \"the engine cannot burn the fuel normally\" appeared many times, and the expression was repeated.\nSo there is a problem of \"duplication\" in the above answer\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nHow is the vehicle? Does it run a red light?", "answer": "When a vehicle is in a red light district, if it exceeds the speed limit, it will be fined. Therefore, when a vehicle is in a red light district, if the speed exceeds the speed limit, it is not considered to have run a red light.\n\nAnswer: When a vehicle is in a red light area, if it exceeds the speed limit, it is considered not to have run a red light.", "reason": "The first and second paragraphs of the answer repeated the answer \"When a vehicle is in a red light area, if the speed exceeds the speed limit, it will not be considered a red light\". The expression is repeated, and the last paragraph can be deleted.\nSo there is a problem of \"duplication\" in the above answer\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWill the hit-and-run be traced?", "answer": "Hit-and-run accidents can be traced, and the police will search for escapees through a variety of means, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Determine information about the fleeing vehicle through evidence from the accident scene and eyewitness accounts.\n\n2. Use surveillance cameras and other equipment to obtain the characteristics and driving trajectories of fleeing vehicles.\n\n3. Conduct an investigation of the accident scene to identify possible clues.\n\nTherefore, hit-and-run accidents will be found, and if the escapee is found, they will face more serious legal consequences, including fines, driver's license revocation and even criminal penalties. Therefore, running away is not a good way to solve the problem. The best thing to do is to obey traffic rules and call the police in time after an accident.", "reason": "The first and last paragraphs of the answer repeat \"hit and run will be found\". It needs to be deleted and the only sentence can be kept.\nSo there is a problem of \"duplication\" in the above answer\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat is the impact of lowering the gasoline label?", "answer": "If high-grade gasoline is added to a car with a low compression ratio or low-grade gasoline is added to a car with a high compression ratio, there will be a \"delayed combustion\" phenomenon, which will specifically cause:\n\n1. Insufficient combustion: The higher the gasoline label, the better the explosion resistance. The lower the label, the faster the combustion speed, which is prone to early combustion and knock, resulting in increased engine carbon deposition, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption.\n2. Engine wear: Knock will cause the piston, connecting rod, crankshaft and other components to resonate, which will increase the wear of the internal parts of the engine in the long run;\n3. Engine failure light is on: When the engine is in a low-load working state for a long time due to oil reasons, the engine computer cannot adjust the fuel injection volume and ignition timing according to the actual working conditions, which may cause the engine failure light to light up.", "reason": "The answers were concise and clear, with no duplicates.\nSo there is no question of \"repetition\" in the above answer\nSo the result is [[B]]", "label": 0}
