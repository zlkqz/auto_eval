Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nA few days ago, (a car APP) took a picture of the Chevrolet Xingmai Luo Mountain Wild Star Riding real car in advance during the 2023 Chengdu Auto Show exploration process. The car can be regarded as the original modified version of Xingmai Luo, which is mainly upgraded in appearance and expansion equipment for outdoor use.\nThe Star Mailo Mountain Wild Star Ride is developed based on the Star Mailo RS series high-end model, and upgraded with green bee green paint, widened black wheel eyebrows and all-terrain tires. At the same time, the Star Mailo Mountain Wild Star Ride is equipped with a storage platform, a bicycle frame and 4 spotlights that can be turned on remotely, so it is different from the original Star Mailo RS in functionality and visual effect.\nIn addition to the appearance adjustment, the Xingmaro Mountain Wild Star Ride has been adjusted in terms of interior materials, which is reflected in the use of Nappa leather wraps in areas such as seats, door panels, steering wheel and shift lever. Other configuration levels are basically the same as the original Xingmaro RS.

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nThe most interesting thing in these cars is the Ideal L9, for no other reason, because the Ideal L9 is the highest-selling high-end large SUV; and the newly launched version is actually a low-end version, and the purpose of the launch is nothing more than to lower the price threshold and further increase sales. Li Auto's \"ambition\" is not small. It seems that tens of thousands of vehicles can no longer satisfy its appetite. Is the Ideal L9 Pro version with a price 429,800 and an actual reduction of 30,000 yuan worth choosing?\nWhether it is worth it depends on the configuration. When the price comes down, the configuration will come down.\nDifferential configurations include:\nAssisted driving chip, Pro version with Horizon Journey 5 single chip, 128TOPS computing power\nMAX version (459,800 yuan), using dual NVIDIA (NVIDIA) Orin-X chips, total computing power 508TOPS\nHigh definition camera · 8 million pixels, Pro version 1, MAX version 6\nOrdinary camera · 2 million pixels, Pro version 9, MAX version 5\nFront-mounted millimeter wave radar, both 1\nUltrasonic radars, all 12\n128-line lidar, Pro version does not have it, MAX version 1.\nThe main difference of the ideal L9 Pro version is the hardware configuration of the intelligent driving system. The core difference is the overhead lidar in the red box, and the comfort configuration and power platform are exactly the same.\nSo what are the differences between these configurations?\nIn short, the ideal L9 Pro version only supports assisted driving in highway scenarios, while the more expensive MAX version supports full-scene assisted driving in urban sections and highways.\nThe difference is this, the rational suggestion option is the ideal L9 MAX, although the price is 30,000 yuan higher, but the hardware standard of the intelligent driving system is higher; do not underestimate the lidar, without this radar in the future, it cannot be upgraded to L3 level and higher standard assisted driving. Ultrasonic radar is of little significance, it is just an ordinary reversing radar. Although millimeter wave radar is not affected by visibility, it cannot complete 3D modeling. So if you particularly like assisted driving and intelligent technology configuration, L9 MAX is an irreplaceable option.\nOn the contrary, if you are more concerned about driving experience, space and comfort configuration, as well as the aura of large SUVs, it doesn't matter. It is not recommended to use assisted driving on general urban roads. After all, the road conditions are too complex, and it is enough for highways to use lane keeping and full-speed adaptive cruising normally.\nLooking at the drive platform again, the ideal L9 Pro is still driven by front and rear dual motors, a four-wheel drive vehicle, with a power reserve of 330kW/620N · m, capable of breaking 100 in 5.3 seconds; the pure electric mode cruising range is still 215 kilometers (CLTC operating conditions), and the range extender model has not changed. It is still a 1.5T four-cylinder engine.\nThe overall competitiveness remains strong, especially compared to the NIO ES8.\nI believe that after the launch of the ideal L9 Pro version, the monthly sales of the car can reach the standard of the total sales of the NIO brand; but it is not that the NIO ES8 is not good, but the price of this car is high. Although the ES8 is equipped with lidar as standard, the guide price is 49.8-59 8,000, and this car is a medium and large car, which is smaller than the ideal L9 body. At the same time, the starting standard of pure electric cruising range is only 465 kilometers, and the highest is only 605 kilometers. It is indeed a bit low. Based on the starting price and other domestic car analysis of the same price, the cruising range of the ES8 should be at least 700 kilometers.\nOtherwise, facing the ideal L9 with no range and charging anxiety, it is inevitable that it will lack competitiveness. It seems that the high-end SUV still depends on Li Auto to perform.", "answer": "Main title: Can the ideal L9 Pro version continue to be brilliant?\nSubtitle: Low price and high matching, L9 is still cost-effective", "reason": "1.

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nNowadays, pure electric vehicles have spread all over the streets, and their low cost of electricity and lighter driving have attracted the attention of consumers. The BYD D1 we are going to introduce today is also a model like this. It is said that it has attracted many online car-hailing users to buy after its launch. Let's take a look at the specific configuration. The explained model is BYD D1 2022, standard version.\nAppearance\nThe exterior design of this car is very simple, and the clean white body is matched with simple lines, which is very durable. The front of the car adopts an upper and lower double-layer structure, the upper headlight group is connected by the black trim in the middle, and the lower grille is connected with the spoiler control on both sides to form a \"mountain\" shape structure.\nFrom the side, the body is designed in a more subtle way. The side windows are connected to the taillights to create the effect of a suspended roof in an unusual way. The doors are very flat, with a straight waist line above the door handle, and a delicate trapezoidal design under the door. The wheels are 16 inches in size and have a petal-like structure.\nInterior\nThe interior design of this car is also very simple. The center console has a small island sticking out from the center, which is used as the control panel for the stop lever knob. The central control screen above is suspended on the bright black trim, with a size of 10.1 inches. What's more interesting is that the seat adopts a two-color design. The commonly used driver's seat is black, which is more resistant to dirt and very user-friendly. Functional aspects support reversing radar, reversing image, vehicle to everything, automatic speech recognition control system and other functions.\nSpace aspects\nThe size of this car is 4390x1850x1650mm, with a wheelbase of 2800mm. This data is still very luxurious. The editor is 176cm tall, sitting in the back row, with about two punches left in the legroom and about one punch on the top of the head, making it very spacious.\npower\nThis car is powered by a 136-horsepower electric motor with a maximum torque of 180N · m, which is very sufficient for daily commuting in the city. In terms of battery life, it is equipped with a lithium iron phosphate battery with a capacity of 53.6kWh, which adopts blade battery technology, which is reliable and safe.\nsummary\nThe overall performance of this car is still relatively good, the only drawback is that the price is not close enough, the official guide price is 160,800 yuan, if you, will you buy it?", "answer": "Main title: Is the BYD D1 worth buying?\n\n** Subtitle: BYD D1 2022, Standard Edition: King of Cost Performance, Spacious Space **", "reason": "1.

Although the appearance has not changed, the most significant change is the addition of the Hi4 plug-in hybrid system, equipped with a 1.5T high-power engine. This model may replace the new Mocha DHT four-wheel drive version that has not been released yet in the future. This article will delve into the design, size and powertrain of the Mocha Hi4.\nExterior design: modern and recognizable\nThe exterior of the Mocha Hi4 continues the modern design concept of the Mocha model. The front face adopts a split headlight set, a double horizontal bar layout, and is connected by a through light strip. The middle grid adopts a polygonal borderless design, which adds a sense of hierarchy. There are also longitudinal air intakes in the fog lamp areas on the left and right sides, with elements such as trapezoidal lower grilles to make the vehicle look more recognizable.\nOn the side of the body, the Mocha Hi4 maintains the iconic lines of the Mocha model, with smooth roof lines, hidden door handles, and large-size wheels, highlighting its sense of style.\nAt the rear of the car, the double-layer through-the-rear taillights increase the recognition. The rear bumper area is decorated with a large area of the same color and bright black, which further enhances the layered appearance.\nSize and practicality: in line with market demand\nThe Mocha Hi4 measures 4881mm (length) x 1960mm (width) x 1690mm (height) with a wheelbase of 2915mm, maintaining the same dimensions as previous versions and adapting to market demands.\nPowertrain: Powerful hybrid performance\nThe biggest change is in the mocha Hi4's powertrain. It packs a 1.5T engine that makes 170 horsepower, one of the highest-powered versions of the Great Wall plug-in hybrid family. This engine may feature entirely new technology. The matching battery pack is from the Ningde era, providing reliable hybrid performance.\nFuture Prospects: Worth Looking Forward to\nThe launch of the Mocha Hi4 offers consumers an affordable and powerful plug-in hybrid option.

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nIn the Chinese car market, for the Japanese luxury brand Lexus, compared to the German top three BBA, although it is far from the sales volume and market share, but in terms of premium retention ability, dealer health, and value retention rate, Lexus has the capital of Xiaoao BBA. Its LX, LM and other models have staggering price increases based on their expensive pricing, and the three-year value retention rate exceeds 100%.\nAs the sales responsibility of Lexus, it is also the first model of Lexus in the Chinese market with a monthly sales volume of over 10,000. The Lexus ES has also had a brilliant and arrogant price increase moment. The price increase was once 20,000 (the nominal disguised price increase of the decoration and maintenance package), but now this car has not only ended the price increase, but also given a 20% discount. The price reduction is about 2-30,000, and in some places even more. And even the value retention rate of the Lexus ES, which was once very eye-catching, has begun to slowly decline. The latest value retention rate research report of the China Automobile Dealers Association shows that the value retention rate of the Lexus ES has dropped from 77.3% in April to 74.8%.\nThe Lexus ES is no longer as beautiful as it was a few years ago. What's going on? So, why is the Lexus ES not working?\nIn fact, it is very simple. On the one hand, the impact brought by the strong rise of Tesla and the Chinese brand electric vehicle army, Lexus has long been no longer a market star, and on the other hand, Lexus itself has been slow to turn around in the face of the general trend of electrification and intelligence. Just like the appearance and interior of this generation of Lexus ES was very stunning when it was first launched, but now many electric vehicles have the shape of a coupe, and the interior is also very sci-fi, becoming a new fashion. In terms of power, the Lexus ES naturally aspirated engine, especially the power meat of the Lexus ES 200 model 2.0 self-priming engine, has been complained and mocked, and even reduced to Internet jokes. It is even more \"weak chicken\" in the face of the fierce power acceleration of the motor. Regarding the intelligent configuration of technology, the Lexus ES has been sidelined by Chinese brand models.\nOf course, this does not mean that the Lexus ES car has fallen behind. On the contrary, this car still has its own unique advantages, such as a very distinctive appearance, an oriental aesthetic interior design, delicate material workmanship, comfortable and smooth driving, and Lexus' always excellent quality, stability, reliability, worry-free and after-sales services. In fact, Lexus ES itself has done nothing wrong, but it is an abbreviation for Lexus' lack of follow-up in the competition.\nIn 2022, Lexus sold nearly 184,000 vehicles in China, a year-on-year decline of more than 16%, which is the first time in its 16 years in China that sales have declined. In the first five months of this year, Lexus sold about 54,000 vehicles, a year-on-year decline of more than 24%. Among them, Quarter 1, Lexus sold 30,258 vehicles, a year-on-year decline of 37%.", "answer": "Main title: Does the Lexus ES fail?\nSubtitle: Lexus ES, as the king of price increases in the past, why is it no longer popular?", "reason": "1.
