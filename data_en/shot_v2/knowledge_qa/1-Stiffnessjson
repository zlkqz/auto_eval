{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nHow about the protective ability of motorcycle helmets?", "answer": "Okay, here's a concise answer to your question:\n\"The protection of a motorcycle helmet depends on its grade and material. SNELL standard helmets are rated 1 to 5, and with each increase in the grade, the helmet can withstand higher speed impacts. The higher the material quality of the helmet, the better the strength, and the better protection it can provide. Therefore, choosing the helmet that suits your needs and making sure to use it correctly to adjust the size and tightness can maximize head safety.\"", "reason": "The answer is not mechanical, the style is not rigid, and there is no content similar to the robot receiving instructions.\nThe answer begins with \"Okay, here is a concise answer based on your question:\" indicates the identity of the respondent as a robot, and the first paragraph should be deleted to start answering the question directly.\nSo the above answer is \"mechanical\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWill long-term failure to maintain and inspect a motorcycle cause mechanical failure or malfunction?", "answer": "Answer: Of course, long-term failure to maintain and inspect motorcycles can lead to mechanical failure or malfunction.\n\n** The reasons are as follows: **\n\n*** Engine: ** Long-term unmaintained engines can cause insufficient oil and gas mixing, air intake system blockage, spark plug damage and other problems, resulting in engine performance degradation, resulting in mechanical failure or failure.\n*** Transmission system: ** Long-term unmaintained transmission systems can cause problems such as chain wear and damage to the drive shaft, resulting in a decrease in the function of the transmission system, which in turn can cause mechanical failure or malfunction.\n*** Braking system: ** Long-term unmaintained braking systems can cause problems such as insufficient braking force and insufficient brake fluid, resulting in reduced braking performance, which in turn can lead to mechanical failure or malfunction.\nOther components that are not maintained for a long time, such as tires, electrical systems, etc., can also cause mechanical failure or malfunction.\n\nOverall, long-term failure to maintain and inspect a motorcycle can lead to mechanical failure or malfunction due to the damage and functional degradation of various components, which affects the overall performance and safety of the motorcycle.", "reason": "The answer is not mechanical, the style is not rigid, and there is no content similar to the robot receiving instructions.\nThe answer begins with \"Answer:...\" This answer format is very blunt and should be deleted and started directly to answer the question\nSo the above answer is \"mechanical\"\nSo the result is [[A]]", "label": 1}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nThe accelerator pedal fails at high speed", "answer": "Q: What should I do if the accelerator pedal fails while the car is driving at high speed?\nA: The vehicle should be slowed to a safe speed as soon as possible, and attempts should be made to repair or replace the accelerator pedal.\n\nQ: How to repair or replace the accelerator pedal?\nA: First, you need to stop the vehicle, then check whether the accelerator pedal is damaged, and replace it with a new one if necessary. If the accelerator pedal is just faulty, the problem can be fixed by repairing or reinstalling it.\n\nQ: How to drive a vehicle in an emergency?\nA: If the accelerator pedal fails, you can use the emergency brake to slow down the vehicle, and control the direction of the vehicle by continuously applying the brakes. At the same time, it is recommended to be vigilant when driving, pay attention to the surrounding environment and road conditions to ensure driving safety.", "reason": "The answer is not mechanical, the style is not rigid, and there is no content similar to the robot receiving instructions.\nThe answer is in the form of a self-question and self-answer, which is too blunt and should be answered directly.

{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat is the reason why cold cars are difficult to start?", "answer": "The reasons why a cold car is difficult to start may include the following:\n\n1. Insufficient battery power: Low temperatures can cause battery performance to decline, and insufficient battery power makes it difficult to start the engine.\n2. Excessive oil viscosity: Under low temperature conditions, oil viscosity increases and fluidity deteriorates, resulting in insufficient engine lubrication and increased starting resistance.\n3. Fuel supply system problems: Low temperatures can cause wax clogging or freezing in the fuel supply system, affecting the delivery and injection of fuel.\n4. Cooling system failure: A problem with the cooling system, such as a coolant leak or a malfunctioning temperature sensor, can make it difficult to start the engine.\n5. Ignition system failure: Spark plug carbon deposition, high-voltage package damage, or ignition coil failure, etc., may affect the ignition effect of the engine, resulting in difficulty in starting.\n6. Starter motor problem: Starter motor aging or damage may cause the engine to fail to start normally.\n\nAddressing these issues requires checking and maintaining relevant components, such as replacing batteries, using the right oil, checking the fuel system, and servicing the cooling and ignition systems. During the cold season, keeping your vehicle well maintained can help reduce problems with starting up.", "reason": "The answer is not mechanical, the style is not rigid, and there is no content similar to the robot receiving instructions.\nAnswering the questions that began to be answered directly, he realized various reasons, and there was no mechanized speech skills similar to the robot receiving instructions, nor self-questioning and self-answering.\nSo there's no mechanistic question in that.\nSo the result is [[B]]", "label": 0}
{"instruction": "Answer according to the following questions, with clarity and no excessive nonsense\nWhat should I do if the brake light or water temperature light is on?", "answer": "If the brake light is on, stop immediately to check the brake system. It may be that the brake pads are badly worn, the brake fluid is insufficient, or there is another problem with the brake system.\nIf the water temperature light is on, you should slow down first and observe whether the water temperature gauge is too high. If the water temperature is too high, you should stop to check whether the heat dissipation system is normal. It may be that the heat dissipation fluid is insufficient or there are other problems with the heat dissipation system.\nWhen the above problems are found, the corresponding parts should be repaired or replaced in a timely manner to ensure driving safety.", "reason": "The answer is not mechanical, the style is not rigid, and there is no content similar to the robot receiving instructions.\nAnswering the questions that began directly, there was no mechanized speech skills similar to the robot receiving instructions, and there was no self-questioning and self-answering.\nSo there's no mechanistic question in that.\nSo the result is [[B]]", "label": 0}
