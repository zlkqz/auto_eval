As a car dealer, I have also sold the most models, and several models that have been well received by customers are quite cost-effective. · The first one is the 18-year-old Cadillac XT5, be sure to buy the four-wheel drive deluxe version with more than one configuration. This car is rare to use the ZF 8AT gearbox, which is quite stable in quality and has a very low failure rate. · The second one is the 18-year BMW 5 Series, which has been replaced with the B48 engine with an unparalleled sense of heaviness and overweight. The top ZF 8AT gearbox has a very low failure rate and excellent value retention rate. The first owner's three-year devaluation has passed, and the second-hand car is currently in the peak of cost performance. · The third model is the 19-year-old Volvo S90T five version, the space super mass is quite stable, it has a very mysterious common problem is low-frequency resonance, 70% of people can't feel it, 30% of people can feel it. So buy this car must go to the test drive in person, if you can't feel it, then hurry up and start. · The fourth model is the 18 brand-new Audi Q5L, which is also the most suitable SUV for home use. The same level of fuel consumption is the lowest in the same level with increased space, and there is almost no common problem. · The fifth model is the 19 Audi A6L, the 40 luxury Zhiya model, the best fuel consumption in the same level, the value retention rate is quite stable, the quality is reliable, and the failure rate is low. The first round of car owners has just passed three years of big depreciation, and the second-hand cost performance is at its peak.

{"id": 65, "instruction": "Reference information: Everyone knows that at the beginning, hybrid is the pronoun of Japanese cars, especially Toyota. Compared with the same version of fuel vehicles, gasoline-electric hybrids are sold as \"expensive\" thieves. With the localization of hybrids and the policies supported by the state, plug-in hybrids have gradually entered everyone's field of vision. Which is better or worse for gasoline-electric hybrids and plug-in hybrids? Sapphire helps you understand the advantages of gasoline-electric hybrids, which do not require charging equipment and are fuel-efficient compared to fuel vehicles. But it is weaker than plug-in hybrids in short-distance energy saving. But compared to plug-in hybrids, it does not require charging equipment, nor is it suitable for energy-saving subsidies, and the price is relatively high. Plug-in hybrid vehicles are obviously energy-saving, have a long range, and have the functions of both ordinary cars and pure electric cars. But it requires fixed charging equipment and places, which are mainly suitable for short-distance travel. And it can achieve zero fuel consumption in short distances, and in the gasoline-electric hybrid mode, the fuel economy is also very good, but it is not as limited as the use of pure electric vehicles. Sapphire concluded: Therefore, if the main problem needs to run long distances often and charging is inconvenient, it is recommended to buy a gasoline-electric hybrid; if it is basically to solve commuting to and from work and there is a suitable place to charge, it is recommended to buy a plug-in hybrid. However, in Sapphire's opinion, plug-in hybrid vehicles can be regarded as a major development direction for future hybrid models, because it allows cars to quickly transition to the pure electric era or the truly clean energy era.\nAnswer requirements: Do not mention that you are based on the above reference information or reference articles, the content of the answer should be concise, clear and accurate, try not to exceed 200 words, and pay attention to the format of line breaks to ensure legibility. \"\nThe question is as follows: Which is worth buying, plug-in mix or oil mix?\nPlease answer:", "answer": " Plug-in hybrids (plug-in hybrids) and gasoline-electric hybrids (oil hybrids) each have their own advantages and disadvantages, and which one is worth buying depends on individual needs.\n\nOil mixing advantages: no charging equipment is required, which is more fuel-efficient than fuel vehicles. But short-distance energy saving is not as good as plug-in mixing, and the price is relatively high.\n\nPlug-in advantages: obvious energy saving, long cruising range, and the functions of both ordinary cars and pure electric cars. Suitable for short trips, it can achieve zero fuel consumption, and has excellent fuel economy in gasoline-electric hybrid mode. But fixed charging equipment and places are required.\n\nSuggestion:\n1. If you need to run long distances frequently and charging is inconvenient, buy oil mixture;\n2. If it is mainly to solve the problem of commuting to and from get off work and there is a suitable place to charge, buy a plug-in.\n\nFrom the perspective of future development, plug-in hybrid models may become the main development direction, contributing to the transition of automobiles to the pure electric era or the clean energy era.", "label": {"0-无翻译外文": 0, "0-竞品/网站/APP或外部引流": 0, "0-专有词汇错误": 0, "0-影响阅读": 0, "0-拒绝回答": 0, "0-错误回答/不相关匹配结果": 0, "0-低价值内容": 0, "0-不符合要求": 1, "1-不符合要求": 0, "1-重复表达": 0, "1-语序不当": 0, "1-分段": 0, "1-主体不精准": 0, "1-答案不全": 0, "1-机械感": 0, "1-软文": 0}, "score": 0}

{"id": 139, "instruction": "Reference information: At present, there are more and more new energy models on the market. Among them, new energy models include phev, hev, and pure electricity. What is the difference between them? How to choose when we buy new energy models? Then, the editor will take you to popular science~ PHEV is a new type of hybrid electric vehicle. It also has an internal combustion engine and a generator. The main power source is the internal combustion engine, which is powered by the motor-assisted drive mode. Moreover, the battery capacity of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is larger than that of oil mixing and can be charged externally, so it can be driven in pure electric mode. HEV is a hybrid model of gasoline and electricity. It is to install an electric drive system under the condition that the original traditional automobile engine drive system remains unchanged, and carry out hybrid drive, which reduces the demand for fossil fuels and improves fuel economy, so as to achieve the effect of energy saving, emission reduction and mitigating the greenhouse effect. EV is the abbreviation of Electric Vehicle, which stands for pure electric vehicle. It has no fuel engine and drives the vehicle through the drive battery and electric motor. Phev can hang the green plate, while hev can only hang the license plate of the fuel vehicle. At present, the hybrid model that can get the green plate in our country's automobile market is a plug-in hybrid vehicle, that is, PHEV. In general, the difference between HEV and PHEV is generally in the form of charging. The HEV converts part of the kinetic energy into electricity through the generator after the engine works, and then charges the power battery. The PHEV can not only rely on the engine to work and charge, but also can charge the power battery with an external power supply. Recently, Lynk & Co launched the 2022 Lynk & Co 01-EMF hybrid version. As the world's first SUV model equipped with Lynk E-Motive intelligent electric hybrid technology. The power of the new car comes from the Raytheon intelligent hybrid technology platform, and its strength should not be underestimated. Lynk & Co Intelligent Electric Hybrid provides 3 hot topic effect, high-performance hybrid engines, 2 high-power rear drive motors, and 2 high-efficiency hybrid transmissions. There are also a variety of high-performance power batteries of different specifications and EM-F (HEV) and EM-P (PHEV) power forms. At the same time, EM-P can realize two-wheel drive/four-wheel drive. Standard/long battery life/super long battery life and other different product types. In terms of fuel consumption, Lynk & Co's intelligent electric hybrid system further creates a lower fuel consumption record. EM-F models equipped with Lynk & Co's intelligent electric hybrid technology have a fuel consumption of as low as 4.5 liters per 100 kilometers of WLTC, and a fuel saving rate of as high as 40% EM-P models have a fuel consumption of as low as 5.1L. Behind the continuous improvement of thermal efficiency and fuel economy, Lynk & Co's intelligent electric hybrid is also uncompromising in performance. In models equipped with three-speed hybrid electric drive DHT Pro, it can eject and start, and it can start 0.5 seconds faster. At the same time, when accelerating overtaking in the high-speed scene of 80-120km per hour, the system will actively downshift and overtake cleanly. Lynk & Co 01 EM-F starts from the youngest 700,000 user request in the automotive circle and opens up its own new dimension for more young users.
