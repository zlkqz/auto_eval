Therefore, changing high-quality oil can improve this situation.\nUse a heater: If your vehicle is equipped with a heater, using it in cold weather can help you start your vehicle easily.\nReplace the battery: Battery loss is one of the common reasons why the car will not start. If your battery has been used for a long time, it is recommended to replace it with a new one.\nUse antifreeze: In cold weather, water freezes inside the engine, which can make the engine not work properly. Therefore, make sure that the freezing point of antifreeze is lower than the local minimum temperature.\nWarm up the engine: Before starting the vehicle, open the door and start the warm air system to raise the indoor temperature. Then open the hood, place a heater or electric blanket over the engine, and allow some time for the engine to reach the right temperature. This can greatly reduce the problem of difficult start.\nCheck the ignition system: The ignition system is one of the keys to the normal operation of the car. If there is a problem with the ignition system, the car will not start normally. Therefore, regularly check the ignition coil and spark plug for aging and other problems, and replace them in time.\nRegular maintenance: Regular maintenance can help you detect and solve problems in your car in a timely manner. For example, replacing the air filter, oil filter and other accessories can ensure the normal operation of the engine and reduce the problem of difficult start.\nIn addition, it is also important to check the oil circuit and engine for any problems. If the problem cannot be solved, it is recommended to send the vehicle to a 4S shop for professional inspection and repair."}
