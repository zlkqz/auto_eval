The maximum power of the system reaches 426kW, the maximum torque is 822N · m, and the 0-100km/h acceleration is as fast as 3.7s.

The Han DM-p God of War version is equipped with a super intelligent electric four-wheel drive.\nRecommended preferred 121km honor type\nIn 2023, BYD changed the model listed, bringing many surprises to consumers. The Qin PLUS champion version of 99,800 yuan, the SEAL champion version of 189,800 yuan and the Han DM-i champion version just listed are all sincere in price. Compared with the 2022 BYD Han DM-i champion version, the price has dropped by 28,000 yuan, and the entry-level model is directly set within 200,000, allowing more consumers to have new choices.\nBYD Han DM-i Champion Edition 121km Elite as an entry-level model, 189,800 yuan, price and 121km pure electric battery life is its advantage, but the configuration is relatively not so rich, 7 airbags, passive pedestrian protection, tire pressure display, L2 DiPilot auxiliary driving system, front and rear parking radar, 360-degree panoramic image, 540-degree image, full-speed adaptive cruise, remote control parking, automatic parking, electric trunk, keyless entry, keyless start, leather steering wheel, 12.3-inch full LCD instrument panel, front mobile phone wireless charging, main and passenger seat electric adjustment, 12.8-inch central control screen, matrix LED headlights, electric adjustment of exterior rearview mirror, automatic air conditioning and other configurations are available.\nBYD Han DM-i Champion Edition 121km Premium Type (guide price: 199,800 yuan) Compared with the Han DM-i Champion Edition 121km Elite Type, the price is 10,000 yuan more expensive, but the configuration has added a panoramic sunroof that can be opened, the main driver's seat waist 4-way support, front seat heating/ventilation, adjustable buttons in the rear of the passenger seat, multi-color ambient lights in the car, etc., and the central control 12.8-inch large screen has also been upgraded to 15.6 inches.\nTo be honest, the budget is within 200,000 yuan to consider the BYD Han DM-i champion version, I recommend the 121km distinguished type, compared to the 121km elite type, spend 10,000 yuan can have a large sunroof to enjoy more comfortable configuration, or very cost-effective.\nBYD Han DM-i Champion Edition 121km honorable type (guide price: 209,800 yuan) compared to 121km honorable type expensive 10,000 yuan, the configuration has increased 19-inch wheel hub, line assist, DOW door opening warning, rear collision warning, reversing car side warning, Dynaudio audio, 12 speakers, in-car purifier and negative ion generator, etc.\nHere, it is recommended that you choose the Han DM-i Champion Edition 121km Honorable Type mainly because this version has a comprehensive range of safety, comfort, and technology configurations, as well as Dynaudio audio to meet your entertainment needs.

It upgrades ordinary leather to genuine leather (leather multi-function steering wheel, leather seat), and adds functions such as external rearview mirrors to increase memory/reversing automatic roll down. For most families, new cars will choose to buy seat covers. Whether it is genuine leather or ordinary leather is of little significance to this part of the user.\nThere are two BYD Han DM-i Champion Edition 200km versions, the exclusive type (guide price: 239,800 yuan) and the flagship type (guide price: 249,800 yuan). Compared with the 121km model, there is no difference in power, but the battery energy is increased to 30.772kWh, adding 220V power interface, automatic anti-glare function and heat pump air conditioning. On this basis, the BYD Han DM-i Champion Edition 200km flagship also adds steering wheel heating and HUD head-up digital display.\nHere, if you feel that the pure electric battery life of 121km cannot meet your daily commuting needs, and you want to be more economical and have a longer battery life, you can choose the pure electric battery life of 200km model.

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nIn fact, it is not difficult to see that almost all car companies will release a lot of models in the compact SUV level, and most of the newly created brands are compact SUVs. Especially in the price range of about 100,000 yuan, which is a very mainstream consumer market in China. Looking at the general environment this year, it seems that if you don't buy a car, you will miss a big bargain.\nToday we bring a new generation model Boyue COOL launched by Geely this year. It is actually a replacement product of Boyue and Boyue X. Even you can understand that it is the youth version of Boyue L.\nappearance\nIn fact, when many friends saw this front face for the first time, they thought it was the Cadillac XT4 with the latest design. Indeed, this very eye-catching tear-eyed headlight is very recognizable. But the interior of the Boyue COOL is a segmented and layered design, which feels like lightning. There is also this through-type light strip, which officially claims that there are 256 LED lamp beads in the headlights. The inverted trapezoidal grille looks more trendy than the Boyue L, and the angular diffusion style presented inside is very aggressive and sporty. In fact, it is obvious from the side of the body that the Boyue COOL is more compact, with a length of just over 4.5 meters and a wheelbase of just over 2.7 meters. It is not a particularly large size in a compact SUV. This is also a dislocation competition with the Boyue L. The highest matching is 19-inch wheels, and the shape is also a two-tone blade design. The other three models are all 18 inches.\nThe most beautiful part of the whole car is the rear, and the tall shape will create a strong visual impact. There is also a high brake light in the center of the top spoiler, forming the finishing touch. The oversized through-type tail light below is still blackened and transparent, giving a strong three-dimensional sense. Although this is only 1.5T power, the bilateral four-out below is a real exhaust.\nInterior\nEntering the car, the overall atmosphere is completely the layout of the new energy vehicle now, very simple and clear. It is basically a copy of the style of Boyue L. The front is also covered with a leather package. Although the top is a hard panel, it is also decorated with brushed craftsmanship and lines, which will not feel cheap. The steering wheel shape is very gamepad-like, and it is also very thick to hold. The front full LCD dashboard reaches 10.25 inches, the left side displays driving information, and the right side can see multimedia entertainment information. The middle screen is also equipped with the latest Galaxy OS system, with a built-in 8155 chip. It is true that this smoothness is much smoother than that of Yadi and Trumpchi.\nSecondly, you can find that most of the function buttons in the car are integrated into the car for operation, even the rearview mirror adjustment and sunroof opening, these buttons are not available. But as long as you have voice control with accurate recognition, then I can accept it.\nThe layout below the center console is actually very similar to Volvo, but the bottom is hollowed out for you, and the storage space is very large. In addition, in terms of configuration, our car also has a panoramic sunroof that can be opened, wireless charging of the front mobile phone, electric adjustment of the main and passenger seats, front seat heating and seat memory function in the driver's seat. 8 speaker speakers and 72-color ambient lights are exclusive to the top model.\nBoyue COOL is equipped with a power combination of 1.5T + 7DCT, the engine is 181 horsepower, 290 Nm, and the official 0-100km/h acceleration time is 7.9 seconds. This engine is found in almost all models of the Geely family.\nThe daily speed range power output is smooth and smooth, with a more positive throttle response, but it is by no means that kind of sensitive feeling. The power performance in the low speed range is good, so it will be more suitable for city driving. If the 7DCT wet dual-clutch transmission maintains normal driving state, the transmission smoothness is no problem.\nAnd Geely's 7DCT with 1.5T engine is actually supplied by Glassett, while the 7DCT with 2.0T is jointly developed by Geely and Volvo. This 7DCT with 1.5T shift speed will be slower than the other. In the face of some overtaking acceleration situations, the response speed of the gearbox cannot be said to be too fast, and the downshift speed is not neat enough. The feeling of semi-linkage is particularly obvious at the start.\nSuspension form for the front McPherson, rear multi-link independent suspension, starting from the actual experience, the suspension for the road bumps filter is not thorough enough, in the face of some high-frequency vibration or speed bumps, the body will have some slight sense of looseness, which has some gap with the Boyue L. In the driving process, the steering wheel is still as light as ever, so don't expect too much driving control. As a 100,000 yuan SUV, L2 driving assistance has appeared in this level of products, the Boyue COOL high-end model is equipped with 5 high definition cameras + 4 radars. It can realize a number of driving auxiliary features such as intelligent pilot system, ACC adaptive cruise control system, AEB pre-collision system, and pedestrian identification protection.\nRecommended models\n2023 model, Boyue COOL 1.5TD smart 115,800\nIt is recommended to choose the smart type. At present, the end point discount on the market is about 5,000 yuan, so basically the naked car 110,000 can buy this 1.5T compact SUV. As a sub-top model, it is better to increase the adaptive far and near light than the low-end model. Opened panoramic sunroof, imitation leather seat, driver's electric adjustment heating, 360 panoramic image and L2-level auxiliary driving.\nsummary\n100,000 yuan to buy an SUV, I rummaged through the car website, the joint venture brand only has very few small SUVs. They also use the design of five years ago, the power of ten years ago, not to mention whether there are modern configurations. But 100,000 yuan you choose Boyue COOL, trendy appearance, intelligent technology interior atmosphere, and 1.5T with this step. 140,000 Feifan F7 volume is the price, new power car-making volume is the service, and 100,000 yuan Geely roll is the ultimate cost performance.", "answer": "Main title: Which 100,000 compact SUV is stronger?\n\nSubtitle: Geely Boyue COOL applies to play, fashionable appearance, intelligent interior\n\nAnalysis: This article introduces a new generation model Boyue COOL launched by Geely, and analyzes its characteristics in terms of appearance and interior.

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nAlthough the penetration rate of new energy in the domestic automobile market continues to increase, in the segment of medium-sized cars, gasoline vehicles still dominate for now. Whether it is Honda Accord or Toyota Camry, they have a bright performance in monthly sales PK. Although Camry lost the \"war\" with Accord last month to compete for the first brother of the B-class car, the delivery of 18193 still opened a sales gap of 3,327 units with the third-place Passat, and Camry's sales in the past year reached 226,529 units.\nGuangfeng Camry currently has as many as 28 models on sale, and the manufacturer's guide price is 179,800-269,800, but recently Camry has also played a \"price war\", and many offline stores have given certain discounts. Take Camry 2023 models, Dual Engine 2.5HGVP leading version as an example, the official guide price is 219,800, but some 4S stores in Shanghai provide the largest 27,000 cash discount, and dealer quotations are reduced to 192,800.\nThe appearance of this Camry dual engine is more radical and bold. The big mouth air intake grille at the bottom becomes the visual center, and the interior is filled with black banners, and it extends all the way to the fog lamp area. With the tusk-like chrome-plated strips on both sides, it completely says goodbye to \"elegance\". The line of sight continues to rise, the blue bull head logo highlights the hybrid identity, and the left and right eagle-eye three-dimensional LED full headlights add a lot of sharpness to the whole vehicle.\nCompared with the arrogant front face, the side of the Camry is obviously more elegant. The body does not use exaggerated decorative elements, only the B-pillar is blackened, showing the visual effect of the suspended roof.
