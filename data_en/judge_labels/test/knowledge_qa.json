If the owner starts the vehicle or stops the vehicle without turning off the engine, if the body shake is found to be obvious, it may mean that the vehicle has the following four conditions:\n\n1. Spark plug or high voltage coil problem\nThis problem is a more common problem, especially the problem of spark plugs, normal use of vehicles generally after 50,000 km may gradually appear this problem. Many repair shops four S 20,000 km requires the replacement of spark plugs, personal advice do not worry, idle jitter when considering the replacement of spark plugs.\n\nThe possibility of high-voltage coil damage is actually very low. The current high-voltage coil may not need to be replaced for a lifetime, and it can be simply cleaned. When the idle jitter fails to solve the problem after replacing the spark plug, the working condition of the high-voltage conductor and ignition coil, the poor working of the ignition system, and the poor jumping condition of the spark plug can also lead to such failures.\nSolution: Check the spark plug for excessive carbon deposits and replace the spark plug.\n\n2. Engine carbon deposition is serious\nThe most common cause of car jitter is the dirty throttle or excessive carbon deposits in the fuel injector. When there is too much carbon deposits inside the engine, the gasoline ejected by the cold start injector will be absorbed by the carbon deposits, resulting in the cold start mixture being too thin, making it difficult to start. In this case, it is easy to get off the car only when the gasoline absorbed by the carbon deposits is saturated. The gasoline adsorbed on the carbon deposits after landing will be sucked into the cylinder by the vacuum suction of the engine and burned, which will make the mixture thicker. The combustible mixture of the engine is thin and thick, causing idle jitter after cold start. The lower the temperature, the greater the amount of oil required for a cold start, and the more the presence of carbon deposits will affect the smoothness of the cold start.\n\nBut similar to this problem, as long as the vehicle is in normal use, the current vehicle 150,000 even within 200,000 kilometers does not need to consider this problem. Even if some carbon deposits are formed, they will not affect the changes in driving and fuel consumption. Many repair shops mislead consumers by taking advantage of this problem. Consumers spend a lot of unnecessary expenses.\n\nAnother point to explain is that now to refuel or to maintain the car, the staff will enthusiastically promote gasoline or oil additives, it is recommended that new cars or normal forms of vehicles within 200,000 kilometers do not add indiscriminately. Briefly explain the so-called no-dismantling removal of carbon deposits must require a lot of acid corrosion. It is unknown whether carbon deposits can be removed, but the damage of acid products to the engine cylinder pad is very serious, and some oil additives will leave a large number of sticky paste-like objects in the oil pan that cannot be removed without dismantling, resulting in less oil retention, increasing the loss of oil and exacerbating the wear and tear of the engine.\nSolution: Clean the oil circuit and check whether the idle motor has carbon deposits.\n\n3. Oil pressure is unstable\nIf you have cleaned the engine carbon deposits, washed the throttle, replaced the oil pad and spark plugs, etc., and still find that the body is shaking during idling, it is recommended that you go to the 4S shop to check whether the fuel supply pressure and the intake pressure sensor are normal. If the oil pump supply pressure is abnormal or the intake pressure sensor value is wrong and the work is poor, it will cause the body to shake.\n\nNow the vehicle can also find this problem through the driving computer data, so be sure to check the driving computer data before going to the physical inspection for similar problems.\nSolution: Check the oil pressure and replace parts if necessary.\n\n4. Aging of engine components\nCar jitter is also related to the aging of the engine foot (also known as the paw pad). The engine foot is actually the shock absorption system of the engine. The engine foot is responsible for absorbing the subtle jitter of the engine when it is running. If there is a problem with the engine foot, these vibrations will be transmitted to the steering wheel and the cab, causing jitter during idling.\n\nThe damage of this part and the shaking are obvious. Sitting in the cab, the steering wheel and the car body will be accompanied by shaking and shaking. Generally, it is relatively serious and easy to find. It is recommended that if there is shaking, especially when idling, go to the four S for inspection and testing to find the corresponding cause and solve the safest and safest one.\nSolution: Replace the parts."}

The Passenger Federation predicts that the sales of new energy vehicles will reach a record high this year, and the annual sales will exceed 8.50 million, and the penetration rate is expected to reach 36%. The current operating status is basically in line with the forecast.\n\nWhile seeing the good news, we must also face some issues rationally. For example, another set of figures should also be taken seriously. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Emergency Management of the People's Republic of China, there were a total of 640 new energy vehicle fires in Quarter 1 in 2022, which is equivalent to an average of more than 7 new energy vehicle fire accidents per day. The probability is much higher than that of traditional fuel vehicles. It is no exaggeration to say that spontaneous combustion has become one of the main safety hazards of new energy vehicles. Prepare for a rainy day and prevent problems before they occur. We should do the following at ordinary times.\nSome new energy car owners may panic when they see this. In fact, don't worry too much. Spontaneous fire is an exception after all. Now the mainstream tram brands on the market are very good at battery protection, and the failure rate is extremely low. We just need to pay more attention when using the car. Please refer to the following points in battery protection;\n1. Avoid charging the battery to 100% or discharging it to 0% as often as possible, and try to keep the battery charged and discharged within the range of 20-80% to prolong the service life of the battery.\n2 Charge regularly, rather than waiting for the battery to fully run out of booster charge. Choose the right time to charge the battery to around 80%, which can provide enough range when needed and reduce overcharging of the battery.\n3 Before using the charging pile, carefully check whether the socket and cable are intact to ensure that there is no damage or debris. This can avoid short circuits or leakage during use of the charging pile, thereby reducing the risk of spontaneous combustion of the vehicle.\n\nNew energy owners should also try to avoid wading or driving in bad road conditions, because the battery pack is located at the bottom of the vehicle chassis. If the vehicle wades or drives on bad roads, it is easy to cause damage to the battery pack, thereby increasing the risk of spontaneous combustion. Because the battery pack is installed at the bottom of the vehicle chassis, if the vehicle wades or drags the bottom, it is easy to cause damage to the battery pack and increase the risk of spontaneous combustion. In addition, regular vehicle maintenance and inspection should be done."}
