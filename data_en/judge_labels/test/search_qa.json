{"id": 195, "instruction": "Reference information: What kind of imported motorcycle is suitable for a person with a height of 165cm? This is a question left by a rider in the background, and his description is as the title. There has always been a saying in the community that \"height is not enough, technology comes together\", so it seems that riding a motorcycle and physical condition are not too necessarily related, but technology, like height, will not be easily changed by our will. It requires some prerequisites to a large extent, so for most riders, height will still affect the normal riding state. I am a rider sharing Thank you for your attention and forwarding! The height of 165cm is more common for people, although now our height is getting higher and higher, but for adults, it has no chance with us, so this problem is not aimed at a certain person, but will have a group. So the question is, what kind of imported motorcycle is suitable for 165cm motorcycle riders? First of all, imported motorcycles can be roughly divided into European and Japanese, among which the European models will be relatively large, and the seat height will also be high, because this is completely developed for people's physical conditions, so some European imported models that can be contacted in China are not friendly to 165cm motorcycle riders, unless it is some low-seat high-end models. The Japanese models will be relatively compact in body structure, and the seat height will be lower. For example, the early CG125 is a typical representative, because their per capita height in the 1980s and 1990s is said to be about 155cm. Of course, now they have also grown taller, and the latest data shows that it has reached about 170cm. It can be seen that Japanese models are relatively more friendly regardless of the type of model. However, the development of motorcycles has been derived from many models, which are not static. Therefore, when choosing a model according to height, it depends on the actual performance of the specific model. Combined with the height of the subject 165cm, imported motorcycles that are more suitable for riding mainly include pedals and princelings. One of the princelings will be relatively easier to land on both feet, because the seat height of such models will generally be relatively low, basically 710mm or less. With such a seat height setting, it is completely feasible for 165cm riders to achieve stress-free driving. While the seat height of some pedal models cannot be as low as that of princelings, it will also be more friendly, and their operating characteristics will also be easier to achieve one foot tilt and start safely, so when choosing, we can focus on these two types of imported models. For example, the following models are a brief recommendation. 1. Yamaha NMAX155 is currently priced at 25,800. This is currently the cheapest Japanese imported motorcycle. It has a seat height of 765mm, has a sports cruising appearance, is equipped with a high-performance water-cooled engine, and has relatively rich basic configuration. It is a relatively good commuter transportation model. 2. Honda CM500 is currently priced at 71800. This car has a family design, the seat height is maintained at 690mm, and it is equipped with a 500cc inline twin-cylinder engine. It is a cruising prince car that can be transported and can travel. If you feel that its power is not enough, then the CM1100 can also be considered. Their appearance has not changed much, but the seat height will be slightly improved but still friendly. 3. Harley tough guy, the current price is 118,400. This is an American cruise prince car. Its body is relatively large, and although it is a prince motorcycle, the seat height is also maintained at 760mm. Therefore, there will still be a little pressure on the subject, but as long as I am used to riding, I can feel happy riding, so I can find an opportunity to try it. In addition to the above three models, there will be many imported models that can also be suitable for the subject's riding, but they will be relatively representative, so you can choose according to this direction.

{"id": 274, "instruction": "Reference information: The picture comes from the Internet. A car is composed of thousands of accessories. During the driving process, all parts of the car must work, and close cooperation should be carried out between each component to ensure the normal operation of the car. There are many common auto parts, such as glass water, wiper blades, water plugs, brake pads, etc. For the repair and maintenance of the car, it is very necessary to know the function of the auto parts. Today, Xiaoda will explain to you the knowledge of auto parts. It is worth every car owner to be familiar with it and ensure driving safety. Let's learn together. First, the introduction picture of the commonly used auto parts comes from the Internet. 1. The function of the car air filter is to filter the dust suspended in the air when the engine is working to ensure clean intake. The air filter element on the car is mostly paper material. Theoretically, the replacement cycle is about 20,000 kilometers. The specific replacement time is mainly based on the use environment and usage. 2. The function of the air conditioner filter element and the air filter is a truth. When the air conditioner is turned on, the dust or pollen that enters the air in the air conditioning system is filtered to ensure that the evaporation tank and the air inside the car are clean. 3. The function of the gasoline filter This accessory is to filter out impurities in the fuel and make the post-combustion mixture entering the cylinder cleaner. On the one hand, it can protect the engine and on the other hand make the emissions more environmentally friendly. Most engines are equipped with disposable non-removable paper filter element gasoline filters. Theoretically, the replacement cycle is 10,000 kilometers. 4. Engine oil is also called engine lubricating oil. If the engine is the heart of the car, then the oil is the blood of the car. Its main function is to flow in the various positions of the engine that need to be lubricated when the engine is running, reducing the wear and tear between the various components of the engine, so as to prolong the service life of the engine. 5. The function of the spark plug for the spark plug is simply to ignite the combustible mixture. The spark plug can introduce the high-voltage current in the battery into the cylinder, generating an electric spark to ignite the mixed gas in the cylinder, so that the cylinder starts to work and start the engine. The spark plug of the car is an accessory that needs to be replaced regularly. Every time the ignition is started, it will cause a certain loss to the spark plug. Bad car habits will also lead to more carbon deposits, which will affect the life of the spark plug. The picture comes from the Internet 6. The main function of glass water glass water is to clean windshield glass and headlights. Glass water is divided into two types: winter and summer glass water. In winter, glass water with a lower freezing point is used according to the local temperature. In summer, glass water is mostly used for cleaning and degumming. 7. The function of wiper blades wiper blades is to refresh the surface of windshield glass in rainy days to ensure a clear field of vision. The wiper blades need to be replaced when wiping is not clean. Theoretically, the replacement cycle is about 1 year. 8. Brake pads, also known as brake pads, are executive parts in the braking system. The quality of the brake pads directly affects the performance of the brakes. When the brake pedal is pressed, the brake pads will be squeezed on the brake disc or brake drum and rubbed to prevent the wheels from rotating. Different driving habits can make a huge difference in the wear of the brake pads. The specific replacement time needs to be judged by yourself. 9. Transmission oil. Transmission oil is also called transmission oil. Its main function is to form a layer of oil film to cushion the strong impact when shifting gears. On the one hand, it can make the gearbox work more smoothly. On the other hand, it can keep the gearbox clean and prolong its service life. The picture comes from the Internet 10. Antifreeze Antifreeze is also called coolant. Its main function is to prevent freezing and dissipate heat to the engine. Of course, antifreeze is not equal to water. The substances incorporated in it can play the role of anti-corrosion and anti-scale. 11. Clutch plate The function of the clutch plate is to transmit power to the transmission. Under normal circumstances, the clutch plate does not need to be replaced, but if you smell burnt smell, shake and gear difficulty in the car, you need to diagnose and troubleshoot whether there is a problem with the clutch. If so, you need to replace it. 2. Introduction to essential tools for car driving 1. Star Auto Repair 121-piece tool set encountered some minor faults or problems that can be solved by yourself. You can use the Shanghai Star Auto Repair 121-piece combination set, which contains different sizes of sleeves, movable wrenches, screw batches and adapters and other on-board tools, which can provide great help in disassembling and assembling car parts and emergency situations.

{"id": 18, "instruction": "Reference information: After going through thousands of choices and bargaining wars, I finally want to pick up the car. I can't hide my excitement, but I often ignore a lot of things when picking up the car. Yesterday, a friend asked what should I do if the new car is scratched? After communication, I learned that the car actually has no scratch insurance. The 4S store only said it was all-insurance and the owner did not read the policy. So what is the main thing to look for when picking up the car at the 4S store? a. See if there are scratches on the paint surface. When a friend mentioned the Jaguar, the small cylinder helped to talk. When picking up the car, the small cylinder found a crack in the gap above the right rear taillight, and finally negotiated a solution. Look at the appearance to be meticulous. The meticulous here does not mean holding the magnifying glass and looking at the car, but not falling off the parts of the car: look at the rearview mirror shell, which is the easiest to scratch; look at the tires for scratches, which affects safety; look at the glass for cracks (including sunroof glass), and see if the spare tire is complete with tools, etc. These are the most basic. b. Look at the interior function keys to turn on the ignition switch. While understanding the function of each function key, verify whether it is normally available. At the same time, check whether the items in the car are missing, such as cigarette lighters, mobile ashtrays, etc. If you want to install navigation, it is recommended that the small cylinder start talking together in the bargaining process of buying a car. Try not to install navigation outside the new car. First of all, it will move the wiring. If the method is not clever, it will make the wiring harness of the car messy and bury hidden dangers for future failures. The navigation of a friend of the small cylinder's A6 installed outside has too much error during use. I plan to replace it. Remove the navigation and see if the lines inside are all messed up. Whether it can be completely removed is an unknown. C. Look at the idle state of the vehicle. Open the engine compartment, start the vehicle, see if the engine shake is regular. At the same time, listen to whether there is any noise coming out, and you can step on the accelerator properly. If the car is brought back, it must be used. So how can the new car run in better? First of all, the running-in includes engine running-in, transmission running-in, and vehicle running-in. The engine will undergo cold running-in when it leaves the factory, so the running-in usually refers to the running-in of the gearbox and the running-in of the whole vehicle. The running-in of the gearbox (including hand gear and automatic gear) starts to move up and down in each gear for about 15-20 minutes, and then moves up and down in another gear for a period of time, and so on. Under the condition that the vehicle is safe to drive, drive at a high speed in the speed range of 90-120 for a period of time. Feel the power output of the engine and make the whole vehicle adapt to the state of high-speed driving. By the way, feel the noise situation (including engine noise and tire noise). Secondly, the new car should avoid slamming on the brake accelerator, which will cause great damage to the car while there are potential safety hazards. Do not fully load and do not speed during the running-in period of the new car. Third, the tire pressure problem. Tire pressure is not the higher the better or the lower the better. Tire pressure is too high or too low may cause tire blowout. Tire pressure is related to tire size and body weight. Every car is different. It is recommended that the owner open the fuel tank cover. Generally, there will be recommended tire pressure values in the fuel tank cover of the car. Finally, no matter what car you drive, I hope you drive civilized. Don't have a fluke mentality.

The maximum horsepower refers to the maximum power output that a car can achieve, which is the same as the maximum power of the engine, but the units of horsepower and power are different. Power refers to the work done by an object in unit time. The more power the engine has, the higher the speed, and the higher the maximum speed of the car. Usually, the maximum power is used to describe the power performance of the car. The horsepower of the engine affects the speed of the car. The torque of the engine affects the acceleration performance of the car, including the starting of the car. In theory, the greater the torque of the engine, the faster the starting speed of the car will be, and the shorter the time for the car to reach the maximum speed. If the engine horsepower is high and the torque is not large, the car speed will be very slow, which is why small-displacement cars will start slowly. The maximum power of the engine is generally expressed in metric horsepower (PS) or kilowatts (kW), 1PS is equal to 0.735kW, and the engine 180 horsepower is equivalent to 135kW, which is equivalent to a 1.5T engine.\nAnswer requirements: Do not mention that you are based on the above reference information or reference articles, the content of the answer should be concise, clear and accurate, try not to exceed 200 words, and pay attention to the format of line breaks to ensure legibility. \"\nThe question is as follows: Is 180 horsepower enough for the univ?\nPlease answer:", "answer": "For a family car, 180 horsepower is sufficient.\nThis horsepower car can reach a top speed of about 200 kilometers per hour.\nThe maximum horsepower of the engine is expressed in PS, which represents the maximum power output that the car can achieve, and is synonymous with the maximum power of the engine, but the units of the two are different.\nThe horsepower of the engine mainly affects the speed of the car, while the torque affects the acceleration performance of the car.\nTherefore, while a 180-horsepower engine may not provide extremely fast acceleration, it is sufficient for daily driving.", "label": {"0-无翻译外文": 0, "0-竞品/网站/APP或外部引流": 0, "0-专有词汇错误": 0, "0-影响阅读": 0, "0-拒绝回答": 0, "0-错误回答/不相关匹配结果": 0, "0-低价值内容": 0, "0-不符合要求": 0, "1-不符合要求": 0, "1-重复表达": 0, "1-语序不当": 0, "1-分段": 0, "1-主体不精准": 0, "1-答案不全": 0, "1-机械感": 0, "1-软文": 0}, "score": 2}
