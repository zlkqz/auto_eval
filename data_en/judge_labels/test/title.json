Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nIn order to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the birth of the classic sports car 911, Porsche recently launched the Porsche 911 S/T special edition model. This special edition 911 combines the design of GT3 Touring and GT3 RS. It is limited to 1963 units worldwide, starting at $291,650 (about RMB 2.0937 million). It can be described as a rare species, a rare frog, not a common item usually sold for cub frogs.\nThe new 911 S/T is also the lightest 911 sports car in the 992 generation. By using lightweight carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and other weight reduction measures, Porsche has successfully reduced the weight of the 911 S/T by 40 kg (compared to the GT3 Touring, which also uses a manual transmission), giving it a weight of only 1380 kg, which also makes it the lightest 911 in the 992 generation.\nIn appearance, you can see that the 911 S/T and GT3 Touring have the same low-key appearance. The car does not use an exaggerated aerodynamic package, but it still has excellent aerodynamic effects. The 911 S/T has a vent design on the hood, which allows for good diversion. On the side of the car, the Porsche 911 S/T has a 20-inch front rim and a 21-inch rear rim, with ceramic composite brakes as standard.\nAnd on the door can be seen there are 63 latte stickers, which is a reminder to the world that the Porsche 911 was born in 1963. As for the rear, you can see it has a through taillight and a mid-mounted double exhaust tailpipe. There is also a 60th anniversary badge on the engine intake at the rear. The Porsche 911 S/T does not have a rear axle steering system. The starting battery is a lithium-ion battery. In addition, compared with other 911 models, the Porsche 911 S/T uses lightweight glass for better sound insulation.\n\nThe interior of the Porsche 911 S/T is not much different from the regular 911 except for the exclusive logo, and the Sport Chrono package on the instrument and center console is a classic cyan color scheme. However, the 911 S/T comes with the Heritage Design package, which comes with a coast blue metal body and white ceramic wheels.\nBuyers can also assign a number between 0 and 99 to the circles on each door of the Porsche 911 S/T, these \"digital badges\" featuring a classic Porsche design that appears on the front, wheel center cover, steering wheel and headrest.\nIn the power section, the Porsche 911 S/T will be equipped with a 4.0L horizontally opposed natural intake engine and a hot-blooded 6MT manual transmission. This power configuration can output a maximum horsepower of 525 horsepower, zero-hundred acceleration in just 3.7 seconds, and a top speed of 300 km/h. For a rear-drive sports car with a manual transmission, it can be described as a very terrifying performance.\nEquipped with a unique lightweight clutch and single-mass flywheel that reduces rotating mass by 23 pounds, Porsche claims that this 911 S/T: \"Now boosts revs with particularly exhilarating speed and directness.\"\nIn addition, in order to coincide with the launch of the Porsche 911 S/T, the Porsche Design team also launched the Chronograph 1 - 911 S/T watch for car owners, which is also a limited edition of 1963, each priced at $13,500 (according to today's exchange rate of about 96,901 yuan, nearly 100,000 yuan a watch, and the rumored Rolls-Royce umbrella is not much), each Porsche 911 S/T with an exclusive watch, using titanium alloy to create the case, and the same attention to lightweight design as the Porsche 911 S/T.\nIf this watch doesn't fit your style, Porsche Design also released the Chronograph 1-75 Porsche Edition watch, which is even rarer, only 475 pieces, and the price is cheaper, \"only\" $11,000 (about 78,965 yuan, almost 80,000 yuan).\nFinally, the Porsche 911 S/T will be officially released in the Rennsport Reunion 7, which opened on September 28, and is expected to be delivered to owners in the spring of 2024 - so, have you been invited to place an order by the sales of the Porsche Center in front of the screen? Of course, I believe that the actual price in the Chinese market will be more expensive than 2.0937 million yuan. The specific price can only be answered by Porsche owners who place an order. Please share your views and opinions on this special edition 911 in the comment area.", "answer": "To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Porsche 911, Porsche recently launched a 911S/T special edition model.

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nIn recent years, the development of new energy vehicles has been relatively rapid, and various car companies have launched many fashionable and handsome models with good quality, which has attracted the favor of many riders. Some riders expressed interest in new energy models and want to know the maintenance cost of new energy models. Take the Qichen D60 EV2022 PLUS SI Comfort Edition as an example. Let's take a look at the cost of this car in the first year.\nIn terms of car cost, let's first look at its energy consumption. The 2022 PLUS SI Comfort Edition of the Qichen D60 EV is equipped with a pure electric 120kW (163Ps) front single motor with a maximum torque of 280N · m. Equipped with a lithium iron phosphate battery, the capacity is 47kWh, and it supports fast charging. Its MIIT pure electric cruising range is 420km, and the power consumption of 100 kilometers is 12.9kWh/100km. We calculate according to the 10,000 kilometers driven a year, the kilowatt-hour electricity is 0.8 yuan, and the annual electricity bill is about 1032 yuan.\nSecondly, in terms of insurance, the guiding price of the car is 139,800, and it is necessary to spend 1450 yuan (including purchase tax 0 yuan, compulsory traffic insurance 950 yuan, license fee 500 yuan, vehicle and ship tax 0 yuan), commercial insurance 5053 yuan (including third-party liability insurance according to 2 million yuan compensation calculation, the cost is 2133 yuan, vehicle loss insurance 2200 yuan, other vehicle liability insurance (driver), vehicle liability insurance (passenger), body scratch insurance total about 720 yuan, the compensation amount can be selected according to your own needs)\nMaintenance costs: for new energy, the first year of the new car almost do not have to do too much maintenance, the general first warranty in 5000 kilometers, and the first warranty is a gift, the rest of the maintenance content required for every 5000 kilometers is basically the maintenance of air conditioning or brake pads, to 10,000 kilometers a year, the annual maintenance cost is about 300 yuan.\nIn addition to these necessary expenses, there will be some inevitable parking fees, high-speed fees, car wash fees, etc. in daily life, as well as accidental illegal fees. This fee is too uncertain, and it should be considered according to your actual situation. We are about 200 yuan a month and 2,400 yuan a year.\nAfter the above introduction, we can calculate that the Qichen D60 EV 2022 PLUS SI Comfort Edition will cost a total of 10,235 yuan per year in terms of energy costs, insurance costs, maintenance costs and daily expenses, which is equivalent to 853 yuan per month. If there is no risk, the subsequent insurance premium will be reduced, and the cost of using the car will also decrease. Do you feel that the cost of using this car is expensive?", "answer": "In recent years, with the improvement of environmental awareness and the continuous emergence of new technologies, new energy vehicles have become more and more popular with consumers. Let's take the Qichen D60 EV 2022 PLUS SI Comfort Edition as an example to see the annual cost of the car.\nThe first is the energy consumption cost of the vehicle. The car is equipped with an electric 120kW front single motor, equipped with a lithium iron phosphate battery, the battery capacity is 47kWh, the pure electric cruising range of MIIT reaches 420km, and the power consumption of 100 kilometers is 12.9kWh/100km. If calculated according to the distance traveled 10,000 kilometers in a year, and the price of electricity is 0.8 yuan, then the annual electricity bill is about 1032 yuan.\nThe second is insurance expenses. According to market estimates, the guide price of this car is about 139,800 yuan, and the necessary expenses are about 1450 yuan, including purchase tax, compulsory insurance, license fee and vehicle and vessel tax. Commercial insurance needs to pay about 5053 yuan, and specific projects can be reasonably selected according to their actual needs.\nAnother problem is the cost of daily maintenance and maintenance. Due to the special nature of electric vehicles, the first year of regular maintenance of a new car does not involve too many operations. Generally speaking, a free first inspection at about 5,000 kilometers can meet the basic daily needs. Regular replacement of other parts is basically aimed at routine work such as air conditioner or brake adjustment in the car. Assuming that the average monthly additional expenditure is about 200 yuan, the total cost of the whole year is within the range of 2400 yuan.\nFinally, some uncertainties that need to be taken into account, such as unexpected fines and other penalties, also need to be added to the overall budget as appropriate. Overall, if there are no special circumstances, the estimated monthly total expenditure should fluctuate within the price range of 853-86 yuan.", "label": {"0-无翻译外文": 0, "0-竞品/网站/APP或外部引流": 0, "0-专有词汇错误": 0, "0-影响阅读": 0, "0-拒绝回答": 0, "0-错误回答/不相关匹配结果": 1, "0-低价值内容": 0, "0-不符合要求": 0, "1-不符合要求": 0, "1-重复表达": 0, "1-语序不当": 0, "1-分段": 0, "1-主体不精准": 0, "1-答案不全": 0, "1-机械感": 0, "1-软文": 0}, "score": 0}

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nThe most interesting thing in these cars is the Ideal L9, for no other reason, because the Ideal L9 is the highest-selling high-end large SUV; and the newly launched version is actually a low-end version, and the purpose of the launch is nothing more than to lower the price threshold and further increase sales. Li Auto's \"ambition\" is not small. It seems that tens of thousands of vehicles can no longer satisfy its appetite. Is the Ideal L9 Pro version with a price 429,800 and an actual reduction of 30,000 yuan worth choosing?\nWhether it is worth it depends on the configuration. When the price comes down, the configuration will come down.\nDifferential configurations include:\nAssisted driving chip, Pro version with Horizon Journey 5 single chip, 128TOPS computing power\nMAX version (459,800 yuan), using dual NVIDIA (NVIDIA) Orin-X chips, total computing power 508TOPS\nHigh definition camera · 8 million pixels, Pro version 1, MAX version 6\nOrdinary camera · 2 million pixels, Pro version 9, MAX version 5\nFront-mounted millimeter wave radar, both 1\nUltrasonic radars, all 12\n128-line lidar, Pro version does not have it, MAX version 1.\nThe main difference of the ideal L9 Pro version is the hardware configuration of the intelligent driving system. The core difference is the overhead lidar in the red box, and the comfort configuration and power platform are exactly the same.\nSo what are the differences between these configurations?\nIn short, the ideal L9 Pro version only supports assisted driving in highway scenarios, while the more expensive MAX version supports full-scene assisted driving in urban sections and highways.\nThe difference is this, the rational suggestion option is the ideal L9 MAX, although the price is 30,000 yuan higher, but the hardware standard of the intelligent driving system is higher; do not underestimate the lidar, without this radar in the future, it cannot be upgraded to L3 level and higher standard assisted driving. Ultrasonic radar is of little significance, it is just an ordinary reversing radar. Although millimeter wave radar is not affected by visibility, it cannot complete 3D modeling. So if you particularly like assisted driving and intelligent technology configuration, L9 MAX is an irreplaceable option.\nOn the contrary, if you are more concerned about driving experience, space and comfort configuration, as well as the aura of large SUVs, it doesn't matter. It is not recommended to use assisted driving on general urban roads. After all, the road conditions are too complex, and it is enough for highways to use lane keeping and full-speed adaptive cruising normally.\nLooking at the drive platform again, the ideal L9 Pro is still driven by front and rear dual motors, a four-wheel drive vehicle, with a power reserve of 330kW/620N · m, capable of breaking 100 in 5.3 seconds; the pure electric mode cruising range is still 215 kilometers (CLTC operating conditions), and the range extender model has not changed. It is still a 1.5T four-cylinder engine.\nThe overall competitiveness remains strong, especially compared to the NIO ES8.\nI believe that after the launch of the ideal L9 Pro version, the monthly sales of the car can reach the standard of the total sales of the NIO brand; but it is not that the NIO ES8 is not good, but the price of this car is high. Although the ES8 is equipped with lidar as standard, the guide price is 49.8-59 8,000, and this car is a medium and large car, which is smaller than the ideal L9 body. At the same time, the starting standard of pure electric cruising range is only 465 kilometers, and the highest is only 605 kilometers. It is indeed a bit low. Based on the starting price and other domestic car analysis of the same price, the cruising range of the ES8 should be at least 700 kilometers.\nOtherwise, facing the ideal L9 with no range and charging anxiety, it is inevitable that it will lack competitiveness. It seems that the high-end SUV still depends on Li Auto to perform.", "answer": "Main title: Ideal L9 Pro price reduction, is it worth buying?\nSubtitle: 330kW power, high-end large SUV competes with NIO ES8", "label": {"0-无翻译外文": 0, "0-竞品/网站/APP或外部引流": 0, "0-专有词汇错误": 0, "0-影响阅读": 0, "0-拒绝回答": 0, "0-错误回答/不相关匹配结果": 0, "0-低价值内容": 0, "0-不符合要求": 1, "1-不符合要求": 0, "1-重复表达": 0, "1-语序不当": 0, "1-分段": 0, "1-主体不精准": 0, "1-答案不全": 0, "1-机械感": 0, "1-软文": 0}, "score": 0}

Generate a pair of main titles and subtitles\nRecently, we learned that Trumpchi E9 Champion Edition ushered in the official listing, the new car launched a configuration model, priced at 349,800 yuan. And in terms of model positioning, the new car is positioned between E9 PRO and E9 MAX.\nIn terms of styling design, like in the front face styling part, the new car is the same as its grandmaster version model, using the front face design of the Oriental Lion, which is not only three-dimensional but also visually impactful. At the same time, we all know that the PRO and MAX models of the new car use the Kunpeng wing front face grille. On the side of the body, through the matching of the through waist line, the body looks very stretched and atmospheric, but also relatively more embossed. There are multiple aluminum alloy wheels under the body. And the tail design is still very square and atmospheric. At the same time, it can be seen that the horizontal and vertical shape design adopted by the through taillight group also better expands the horizontal visual sense of the tail, and the visual effect after lighting is also very prominent. In addition, the fast and slow charging interfaces of the new car are set on the left side of the tail, and the new car also supports V2L 3.3kW external discharge and V2V 5.5 kW vehicle-to-vehicle discharge function.\nIn terms of interior design, the new car provides two sets of interior styles, Yunshan Zhushui and Opera Palace, for consumers to choose from, and is equipped with a 12.3-inch combined driving control instrument and a 14.6-inch large floating central control screen. As for the configuration, compared with the E9 PRO model, the new car has more rear side windows, manual sunshades, leather seats, driver/rear power seat memory, adjustable buttons in the rear passenger seat and rear small table boards. In terms of price, the difference between the two is 20,000 yuan; compared with the E9 MAX model, the E9 MAX model has more fatigue driving tips, 15.6-inch rear LCD screen, active noise reduction, streaming media rearview mirror, steering wheel heating and other configurations. In terms of price, the difference between the two is also 20,000 yuan. Therefore, it can be seen that its configuration is relatively moderate and practical.\nIn terms of power, the new car is equipped with a 2.0TM hybrid special engine developed by GAC Trumpchi, with a maximum power of 140kW and a maximum torque of 330N · m, while the system has a comprehensive maximum power of 274kW and a maximum torque of 630N · m. The transmission system is matched with the GMC 400 two-speed DHT gearbox. In terms of battery, the new car is equipped with a 25.57kWh battery pack, with a pure electric battery life of 136km under CLTC conditions, and a fuel consumption of 6.05L/100km under WLTC comprehensive conditions. The comprehensive battery life can reach 1032km.\nThe latest car opinion: The Trumpchi E9 Champion Edition is positioned between the E9 PRO and the E9 MAX in its lineup, relatively further refining and enriching the product matrix. Of course, in terms of price and configuration, it should also be more moderate. Therefore, friends who are more interested in the Trumpchi E9 have a tight budget and do not have particularly high requirements for configuration.

According to the latest announced sales, the best-selling car in the entire sedan, SUV and MPV market is Model Y, which has won a dazzling result of 51,471 units at the price of 263,900. What is the concept of this number? This means that the revenue of this car alone has reached tens of billions of yuan, and this is the result of calculating the lowest price in 263,900. Model Y is undoubtedly a real \"explosion king\". This article starts from the product power of Model Y and talks about it.\nAt present, Model Y has 3 models on sale, divided into rear drive and four-wheel drive version, the official guide price is 26.39-36 3,900, including the introduction reward discount, the rear drive version of this car can be controlled at 26-270,000, to Tesla's current market, this price is more attractive.\nIn terms of appearance, the Model Y is like a fattened version of the Model 3. The overall design is still family-style. The round line design is matched with a closed air intake grille, which looks very simple and atmospheric. On both sides, there are sporty diversion grooves, and the raised rib lines on the hood make the whole front of the car more visually low. The rear of the car is still standardized, with symmetrical tail lights and ducktail spoiler design, which has obvious sporty style gains. However, the car's paint is thinner, and scratches may be left if you don't pay attention, which is a point that needs attention.\nOn the side of the car body, it adopts a slip-back design, blackened window trim and privacy glass, which has better privacy. Model Y has a length, width and height of 4750 * 1921 * 1624mm, and a wheelbase of 2890mm. The data performance is fair. At the same time, because of the slip-back design, the height of the rear row is not cushioned enough, and it is easy for taller passengers to head. However, the rear seats of the car can be laid flat, and there is a mattress that can turn the rear row into a bed in seconds, which has a high utilization rate in terms of space flexibility.\nEntering the car, the center console has only a standard 15-inch touch display screen for all series, and it also integrates the dashboard function. On the left is the Tesla-style steering wheel. The center console is decorated with soft materials and wood grain trim, and the overall style is minimalist. This minimalist style is excellent for space flexibility, but too minimalist is not an advantage. For example, the sunroof of the car does not even have a sunshade, which has an impact on travel comfort. In addition, there are no extra physical buttons in the car, which is inconvenient to operate during driving, but this is also controversial. Some people can operate various functions naturally after getting used to it, but it takes a relatively long time to adapt and learn.\nThe whole system comes standard with common car configurations such as automatic speech recognition control, vehicle to everything, and mobile APP remote control. And the car comes standard with L2-level auxiliary driving, and can be equipped with high-end smart driving functions through price increases, but I personally think it is unnecessary. After all, most cities in China only have L2-level smart driving functions. In fact, there are redundancies. Other basic configurations, Model Y is basically not absent, such as reversing images, heat pump air conditioning, mobile phone wireless charging, and also has highlights such as second-row seat heating, steering wheel heating, and main driver memory, which perform well.\nComing to the core part of the electric car, the car has three different cruising ranges, corresponding to three configuration styles. Under CLTC conditions, its pure electric range is 545km, 660km, and 615km respectively. The former is a combination of single motor + 60kWh battery, with a maximum power of 194kW (264Ps); the middle and the latter are a combination of front and rear dual motors + 78.4kWh battery. Although the power combination is the same, the specific power is different. Specifically, the long-drive battery life version has a cruising range of 660km, a maximum power of 331kW (450Ps), and a maximum torque of 559N · m, focusing on battery life; the high-performance version has a maximum of 357kW (486Ps), a maximum torque of 659N · m, and can complete a 0-100km/h sprint in 3.5s, focusing on performance.\nIn terms of dynamics, the car uses a combination of double fork arm + multi-link independent suspension, and Tesla has adjusted its chassis for partial control. On the basis of ensuring a certain comfort, the driving control experience is also good. However, compared with the mainstream household SUV, its suspension adjustment is still hard, and the effect of filtering potholes and bumpy roads is not good. At the same time, the turning radius of the car is too large, and the steering is also a little empty. For narrow roads, it needs multiple operations, and the noise control is slightly poor. After all, the use of borderless doors still lacks noise suppression.\nOverall, the Tesla Model Y, as a true \"hit king\", has won wide attention for its excellent product strength and sales results. Although there are some flaws, its advantages are still significant in the market, and no car is perfect. If it is not the pursuit of performance, then consider its rear-drive version is enough for daily use. After all, its 100-kilometer acceleration time has also reached 6.9 seconds. If you have to pursue performance or driving experience, it is better to choose the Model 3, which has a relatively harder chassis adjustment and a more sporty driving experience.", "answer": "Main title: Why are Tesla Model Y sales so hot?\nSubtitle: Analyzing the Product Strength and Advantages of Model Y", "label": {"0-无翻译外文": 0, "0-竞品/网站/APP或外部引流": 0, "0-专有词汇错误": 0, "0-影响阅读": 0, "0-拒绝回答": 0, "0-错误回答/不相关匹配结果": 0, "0-低价值内容": 0, "0-不符合要求": 0, "1-不符合要求": 0, "1-重复表达": 0, "1-语序不当": 0, "1-分段": 0, "1-主体不精准": 0, "1-答案不全": 0, "1-机械感": 0, "1-软文": 0}, "score": 2}
